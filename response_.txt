      "keyInsights": [
        "The challenge at Statsic is to balance accessibility and rigor in A/B testing, providing tools that guide users towards best practices without overwhelming them with technical details.",
        "Data scientists at startups often need to be versatile, taking on roles like data engineering, architecture, and even business strategy due to limited resources.",
        "Experimentation is humbling as it often shows that even the most promising ideas might only have a small impact or none at all, highlighting the need for continuous calibration of expectations.",
        "Data maturity in companies varies, with some bringing on data personnel early, while others delay until the company grows larger.",
        "The value of data scientists in startups lies in their ability to educate and up-level the team's analytics capabilities, not just in producing insights."
