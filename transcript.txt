[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,839] So I want to ask you a few questions about kind of a journey of having this startup
[00:00:05,839 -> 00:00:07,839] Yeah, because you have a very unique
[00:00:08,519 -> 00:00:15,359] Profile, right? You're working at your early careers in large companies and now you do startup
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:21,640] How did it feel? Like I remember last time I was interviewing you we talked about making this
[00:00:22,160 -> 00:00:24,160] leap of faith, right?
[00:00:27,000 -> 00:00:33,000] I still feel that way. When were you most unsure?
[00:00:33,000 -> 00:00:38,000] I mean, I think you can never eliminate that.
[00:00:38,000 -> 00:00:40,000] I will just be honest, right?
[00:00:40,000 -> 00:00:46,380] There are times when I wake up when I feel so happy, excited about the possibilities,
[00:00:46,380 -> 00:00:49,640] the positive possibilities about Statsync.
[00:00:49,640 -> 00:00:54,359] And then there are days when I wake up and I'm like, there are 45 people that work at
[00:00:54,359 -> 00:01:00,079] Statsync and they all have families, some of them have kids, and so now all of the livelihoods
[00:01:00,079 -> 00:01:04,400] of everything is dependent on the success of this company, which puts a lot of pressure.
[00:01:04,400 -> 00:01:06,560] And so, some days those things are like,
[00:01:06,560 -> 00:01:07,680] you know, ways down, right?
[00:01:07,680 -> 00:01:09,719] As a founder, you know, you're responsible
[00:01:09,719 -> 00:01:11,719] for building something that people believe in,
[00:01:11,719 -> 00:01:16,719] people have invested their time and their families.
[00:01:16,799 -> 00:01:20,519] Yeah, I feel like making decisions about products
[00:01:21,599 -> 00:01:22,599] easy, actually.
[00:01:22,599 -> 00:01:24,799] Like if you work at a large company,
[00:01:24,799 -> 00:01:26,159] if you want to cut some product,
[00:01:26,159 -> 00:01:28,319] you can make the decision right away.
[00:01:28,319 -> 00:01:30,879] It's very difficult when it's the most people.
[00:01:30,879 -> 00:01:33,560] So it's a never ending thing.
[00:01:33,560 -> 00:01:36,280] So there's a spectrum of possibilities in a startup.
[00:01:36,280 -> 00:01:37,719] On the one end of the spectrum,
[00:01:37,719 -> 00:01:41,359] you can go bankrupt, you can make a bad decision
[00:01:41,359 -> 00:01:42,640] that could impact the product
[00:01:42,640 -> 00:01:45,480] and we could go bankrupt right away.
[00:01:45,480 -> 00:01:51,040] We could have a security issue and that could just kill our business instantly.
[00:01:51,040 -> 00:01:54,939] The possibility is still there, it's a non-zero probability.
[00:01:54,939 -> 00:01:59,120] Our goal is to reduce that to as close to zero as possible.
[00:01:59,120 -> 00:02:03,459] And on the other end of the spectrum is that, you know, okay, our startup just goes really
[00:02:03,459 -> 00:02:11,159] successful someday four or five years from now, we're all very successful, we're all very happy, and then that probability,
[00:02:11,159 -> 00:02:15,800] even though it's non-zero, it's a tiny probability, but we're all trying very hard to like increase
[00:02:15,800 -> 00:02:18,060] that probability.
[00:02:18,060 -> 00:02:23,439] But what gets me up a day, every day, waking up and getting excited and coming into work
[00:02:23,439 -> 00:02:25,159] is the middle. The middle is
[00:02:25,159 -> 00:02:31,159] where I get to do really valuable, really exciting work with really amazing people.
[00:02:31,159 -> 00:02:37,319] It's kind of like one of those zero overhead, you get to come in,
[00:02:37,319 -> 00:02:42,000] you're productive, you come excited, you leave exhausted, in the middle you're so
[00:02:42,000 -> 00:02:49,240] productive. That's what drives you every day like every single day you wake up and you want to do that right and that's
[00:02:49,240 -> 00:02:54,919] what is exciting about a startup I think I told you the last time if you're an
[00:02:54,919 -> 00:02:59,120] entirely rational person you wouldn't want to join a startup the expected
[00:02:59,120 -> 00:03:02,759] outcome of a startup when you add all the risk in there it's kind of like you
[00:03:02,759 -> 00:03:05,639] know less than what you would do in a big company.
[00:03:05,639 -> 00:03:06,479] Depends.
[00:03:06,479 -> 00:03:09,080] I feel like the rational is about the financial income.
[00:03:09,080 -> 00:03:11,000] You were talking about the financial income.
[00:03:11,000 -> 00:03:14,560] But rational I think also means knowing yourself.
[00:03:14,560 -> 00:03:15,400] And which I said, right?
[00:03:15,400 -> 00:03:16,360] Exactly, I think you're right.
[00:03:16,360 -> 00:03:17,199] Absolutely.
[00:03:17,199 -> 00:03:18,039] So I think you're,
[00:03:18,039 -> 00:03:19,479] so there's an element of like,
[00:03:19,479 -> 00:03:20,960] people that choose startups,
[00:03:20,960 -> 00:03:23,599] choose it for non-monetary reasons.
[00:03:23,599 -> 00:03:28,080] Because if you're only choosing it for monetary reasons, you wouldn't have to, you shouldn't.
[00:03:28,080 -> 00:03:33,199] So you would choose a startup because you like the people that
[00:03:33,199 -> 00:03:36,879] you want to work and you're excited by the mission of the startup, you want to
[00:03:36,879 -> 00:03:41,039] have a much larger impact, you want to learn more. Those are
[00:03:41,039 -> 00:03:45,759] the factors that go into why would someone join a startup?
[00:03:45,759 -> 00:03:46,919] And that's kind of like, you know,
[00:03:46,919 -> 00:03:50,080] that fundamentally that drives you to like, you know,
[00:03:50,080 -> 00:03:53,560] go be here in a place like Stats Inc.
[00:03:53,560 -> 00:03:54,479] Nice.
[00:03:54,479 -> 00:03:59,479] So all good experiences, like even the bad experiences
[00:03:59,960 -> 00:04:01,759] or the fearful experiences,
[00:04:01,759 -> 00:04:03,439] aren't a good part of the-
[00:04:03,439 -> 00:04:04,539] Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:04,539 -> 00:04:09,000] Yeah, no, I mean, I will remember this till the rest of my life.
[00:04:09,000 -> 00:04:11,159] These are memories that we're making.
[00:04:11,159 -> 00:04:14,000] Every single thing that we do here, every decision we make,
[00:04:14,000 -> 00:04:16,720] whether good or bad, we learn.
[00:04:16,720 -> 00:04:25,519] But the idea is that I believe I'm making memories that I'll remember forever.
[00:04:36,319 -> 00:04:36,819] Nice. I couldn't detect any difference between now and I think last time we did the interview was 15 months ago. Yeah.
[00:04:36,819 -> 00:04:40,000] Yeah. Do you notice any difference?
[00:04:40,000 -> 00:04:41,360] Um...
[00:04:41,360 -> 00:04:51,000] Like yourself? No, I think I'm still just as excited as I was about the prospects and the future of Statsik.
[00:04:51,000 -> 00:04:56,000] And, well, I mean, obviously the last time we didn't have customers.
[00:04:56,000 -> 00:05:03,000] Now we have customers, so there's a validation about the product that is really good and fulfilling.
[00:05:03,000 -> 00:05:05,639] And so that was, that's really good and fulfilling. And so that's always good.
[00:05:05,639 -> 00:05:07,600] Now, obviously we've grown quite a bit.
[00:05:07,600 -> 00:05:12,600] So, we're now more, I guess, like larger and more mature.
[00:05:15,879 -> 00:05:18,120] And so we're making process decisions
[00:05:18,120 -> 00:05:19,259] and things like that.
[00:05:19,259 -> 00:05:22,319] So I think like we've just moved on to,
[00:05:22,319 -> 00:05:24,819] I would say stage number two from stage number one
[00:05:24,819 -> 00:05:26,079] when we were talking before.
[00:05:26,160 -> 00:05:27,120] What's stage number two?
[00:05:27,519 -> 00:05:28,680] I'm just making it up.
[00:05:29,519 -> 00:05:29,800] Oh yeah.
[00:05:29,800 -> 00:05:32,480] I feel like stage number one is fighting for survival.
[00:05:32,519 -> 00:05:32,879] Yeah.
[00:05:32,920 -> 00:05:37,759] Just like all energies into building the product, but stage number two, you
[00:05:37,759 -> 00:05:40,160] probably need to think about management.
[00:05:40,160 -> 00:05:42,959] Yeah, the process and structure.
[00:05:43,480 -> 00:05:48,000] The other thing which is fundamentally important, is
[00:05:48,000 -> 00:05:52,000] when you're that early, the last time we spoke,
[00:05:52,000 -> 00:05:56,000] you build products in a vacuum, where you have an idea that you
[00:05:56,000 -> 00:06:00,000] believe is the right direction for the product.
[00:06:00,000 -> 00:06:04,000] But what we're doing now is very different from what we did before, because now
[00:06:04,000 -> 00:06:05,120] a lot
[00:06:05,120 -> 00:06:10,279] of the features and the roadmap is directed by what our customers are asking for and what
[00:06:10,279 -> 00:06:11,800] our customers are needing.
[00:06:11,800 -> 00:06:16,360] And so while we do have like, you know, vision for like their areas that we invest kind of
[00:06:16,360 -> 00:06:22,399] like, you know, future product areas, a lot of the existing products and then the evolution
[00:06:22,399 -> 00:06:24,839] of that is driven by feedback.
[00:06:24,839 -> 00:06:27,439] And our customers are giving some amazing feedback.
[00:06:27,439 -> 00:06:32,240] So, which is great because sometimes you can't go too long in a vacuum.
[00:06:32,240 -> 00:06:36,319] You want to like actually get feedback and then that, you know, feeds in.
[00:06:36,319 -> 00:06:42,720] Yeah, like I interviewed Vantarain in 2P Business in Silicon Valley.
[00:06:42,720 -> 00:06:45,000] He was the VP at VMware.
[00:06:45,000 -> 00:06:46,360] VMware.
[00:06:46,360 -> 00:06:46,879] Yeah.
[00:06:46,879 -> 00:06:49,439] And he built the network structure there.
[00:06:49,439 -> 00:06:53,800] He's also a serious entrepreneur and investor.
[00:06:53,800 -> 00:06:58,959] And he talked about how, like, I had a specific question for him.
[00:06:58,959 -> 00:07:00,759] Like, part of market fit.
[00:07:00,759 -> 00:07:05,439] He emphasized the importance of part of my fit which I resonate a lot.
[00:07:06,240 -> 00:07:11,360] But the question was, do people usually find part of my fit right away or do they have to
[00:07:11,360 -> 00:07:17,360] pivot many times to find it? I guess my question to you is, what is our biggest pivot?
[00:07:20,079 -> 00:07:29,800] Yeah. How do you feel about that? One of the good things about StatsInc was that we used all these products inside, all
[00:07:29,800 -> 00:07:31,000] these tools inside Facebook.
[00:07:31,000 -> 00:07:33,000] You kind of know the destination.
[00:07:33,000 -> 00:07:40,680] Yeah, so we kind of skipped one of the steps of actually what should we build.
[00:07:40,680 -> 00:07:42,660] Because we knew what to build.
[00:07:42,660 -> 00:07:46,000] We knew how people inside Facebook used these products.
[00:07:46,000 -> 00:07:49,000] And how they evolved and how it scaled.
[00:07:49,000 -> 00:07:57,000] So a lot of the learnings, basically, early stage product development was driven by the learnings that we had from Facebook.
[00:07:57,000 -> 00:08:01,000] So in a way, we were fortunate enough to have that kind of insight.
[00:08:01,000 -> 00:08:03,000] You were the customers.
[00:08:03,000 -> 00:08:05,519] Correct. And now we're kind of like building it for other people.
[00:08:05,519 -> 00:08:08,759] So it became a much easier problem for us. I mean,
[00:08:08,759 -> 00:08:13,399] I if other people are building stuff like that more power for them,
[00:08:13,399 -> 00:08:14,959] because it's good. You know,
[00:08:14,959 -> 00:08:19,000] you save a whole bunch of like back and forth and, and a lot of pivots.
[00:08:20,199 -> 00:08:23,959] But since then we've also like added a bunch of features that didn't exist
[00:08:23,959 -> 00:08:26,000] inside Facebook tools.
[00:08:26,000 -> 00:08:32,960] Things along the lines of reviews, visual diffs of feature gates, and visual diffs of experiments,
[00:08:32,960 -> 00:08:37,919] and then auditing of these reviews, what people are changing across the board,
[00:08:38,960 -> 00:08:43,919] and then who gets control, who acts... Those are things that companies want.
[00:08:43,919 -> 00:08:46,000] Yeah, I feel like those are real demands.
[00:08:46,000 -> 00:08:50,000] Just because Facebook culture and how the teams are set up.
[00:08:50,000 -> 00:08:54,000] Yeah, I think the culture at Facebook is like anyone can go modify anything.
[00:08:54,000 -> 00:08:58,000] I think at that point we were kind of like, engineers made the right calls,
[00:08:58,000 -> 00:09:00,000] the judgment was there.
[00:09:00,000 -> 00:09:05,600] And then here, it's a little bit like, you know, the companies that we work with, they
[00:09:05,600 -> 00:09:10,200] care about, there should be a process and that should go through this process.
[00:09:10,200 -> 00:09:13,559] And there should be one person that actually reviews all of that and approves.
[00:09:13,559 -> 00:09:18,200] And so they asked for those kind of tools, and we built them.
[00:09:18,200 -> 00:09:19,200] Nice.
[00:09:19,200 -> 00:09:20,200] Yes.
[00:09:20,200 -> 00:09:25,000] How is Answer about pivoting as the technical insights was always there.
[00:09:25,000 -> 00:09:29,200] Those are rarely pivoted or getting pivoted.
[00:09:29,200 -> 00:09:32,200] But the pivot theory is how to find a customer.
[00:09:32,200 -> 00:09:35,799] Yeah, like who is our customer and how to pitch them.
[00:09:35,799 -> 00:09:36,799] Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:36,799 -> 00:09:42,799] And sometimes you'll be surprised how different each customer is
[00:09:42,799 -> 00:09:46,940] and what they focus on, what kind of areas that they focus on,
[00:09:46,940 -> 00:09:49,080] and then sometimes you have to build it
[00:09:49,080 -> 00:09:51,340] to earn their business.
[00:09:51,340 -> 00:09:54,240] All right, my last question about kind of still
[00:09:54,240 -> 00:10:01,820] the challenges of running to be a software is sometimes,
[00:10:01,820 -> 00:10:03,320] I think there is a trade-off.
[00:10:03,320 -> 00:10:07,639] Do you want to spend more time and resource to optimize our product?
[00:10:07,639 -> 00:10:09,840] Or do you want to spend more resource
[00:10:09,840 -> 00:10:13,279] on serving our customers' specific need to customize?
[00:10:13,279 -> 00:10:15,639] How do you balance that?
[00:10:15,639 -> 00:10:19,240] Yeah, initially when we had only a few customers,
[00:10:19,240 -> 00:10:22,960] we were basically addressing every single customer needs.
[00:10:22,960 -> 00:10:26,080] Now, one thing to keep in mind is like
[00:10:26,080 -> 00:10:32,639] when a customer asks for a feature, I think you can also quickly identify if this is something
[00:10:32,639 -> 00:10:36,879] that is going to be valuable for all the other customers, in which point we prioritize that much
[00:10:36,879 -> 00:10:42,639] higher, or is this something that is valuable only for the specific user or customer because of their
[00:10:42,639 -> 00:10:45,759] unique needs. In those cases, what we
[00:10:45,759 -> 00:10:49,919] ended up, we quickly understood. We didn't know about this, we
[00:10:49,919 -> 00:10:54,879] learned it along the way. So you can tell right away. And then, so we
[00:10:54,879 -> 00:10:59,080] generally prioritize the ones that are beneficial for a larger set of
[00:10:59,080 -> 00:11:03,639] customers than the other ones. Sometimes we throw them into the back burner and
[00:11:03,639 -> 00:11:05,159] sometimes we talk to them,
[00:11:05,159 -> 00:11:06,299] how important is it?
[00:11:06,299 -> 00:11:07,539] When do you want this by?
[00:11:07,539 -> 00:11:09,100] And then we can work through.
[00:11:09,100 -> 00:11:13,240] Now that we have a broad set of customers,
[00:11:13,240 -> 00:11:18,080] we generally put everything into our backlog
[00:11:18,080 -> 00:11:20,820] and then we then prioritize that
[00:11:20,820 -> 00:11:23,179] as a kind of like a global prioritization
[00:11:23,179 -> 00:11:27,000] of who wants this and how many people want
[00:11:27,000 -> 00:11:30,360] this and when should we build this, does it make sense and so on.
[00:11:30,360 -> 00:11:34,840] Now it is important to like not entirely, your product roadmap should not entirely be
[00:11:34,840 -> 00:11:36,960] controlled only by customer requests.
[00:11:36,960 -> 00:11:37,960] Of course.
[00:11:37,960 -> 00:11:43,720] There is a, so I think like we have thirds, so one third is driven entirely by customers,
[00:11:43,720 -> 00:11:47,639] one third is driven by like what we believe is the next level
[00:11:47,639 -> 00:11:50,159] or next level of sophistication for the existing tools
[00:11:50,159 -> 00:11:52,200] that may not be driven entirely by customers.
[00:11:52,200 -> 00:11:55,519] The third one is completely new areas of exploration.
[00:11:55,519 -> 00:11:58,200] So we recently launched Events Explorer,
[00:11:58,200 -> 00:12:01,120] which is basically a scuba inside Facebook.
[00:12:01,120 -> 00:12:03,320] So it's a real-time query engine.
[00:12:03,320 -> 00:12:05,000] So what we do is we take the data.
[00:12:05,000 -> 00:12:05,840] You have that test file.
[00:12:05,840 -> 00:12:10,159] Yeah, so we take all of the data inside that the customers have,
[00:12:10,159 -> 00:12:11,879] and then we sample it.
[00:12:11,879 -> 00:12:14,799] And then we take the sample data and we put it in physical RAM.
[00:12:14,799 -> 00:12:17,200] And then we put a query engine on top of physical RAM.
[00:12:17,200 -> 00:12:19,360] So that way, you can ask questions.
[00:12:19,360 -> 00:12:22,799] And instead of waiting 10 minutes, 15 minutes,
[00:12:22,799 -> 00:12:24,960] you get sub-second results.
[00:12:24,960 -> 00:12:30,519] And the interesting benefit of a sub-second result is that you can ask a lot more questions
[00:12:30,519 -> 00:12:36,919] and you can quickly identify anomalies which are masked by averages, which is a good way
[00:12:36,919 -> 00:12:39,120] to debug stuff.
[00:12:39,120 -> 00:12:47,000] Scuba is so powerful and I can't imagine living without scuba, right? And so the idea is that nobody asked for it,
[00:12:47,000 -> 00:12:51,000] but we built it because that's the new area that we can,
[00:12:51,000 -> 00:12:53,000] as long as we continue expanding the service area,
[00:12:53,000 -> 00:12:57,000] we're going to be adding value to our customers.
[00:12:57,000 -> 00:13:03,000] Yeah, I have this painful expression because I'm jealous of people
[00:13:03,000 -> 00:13:05,440] who get to use this kind of tools.
[00:13:05,440 -> 00:13:10,679] The infrastructure of big companies sometimes are just lacking.
[00:13:10,679 -> 00:13:16,980] I think it's so, I think just the fact that Facebook invested so much in
[00:13:16,980 -> 00:13:21,639] infrastructure and had the foresight to like put some of the best engineers on
[00:13:21,639 -> 00:13:26,519] the internal tools is unique. I don't see that in many
[00:13:26,519 -> 00:13:32,320] companies. And that's basically like, you know, when we build these, there are about
[00:13:32,320 -> 00:13:39,120] 20 tools inside Facebook that we want to build. I think we're at like 3 or 4 right now. And
[00:13:39,120 -> 00:13:46,000] the possibilities are endless. As long as the team continues to just crank out features so fast.
[00:13:50,120 -> 00:13:50,200] I think over the next year or so we'll have a pretty broad set of tools.
[00:13:53,639 -> 00:13:55,840] Yeah. Sorry, I mentioned last question, but I know I have one more question. No worries. Data quality of our customers.
[00:13:55,879 -> 00:13:56,080] Yeah.
[00:13:56,080 -> 00:14:01,799] Like I feel like being able to run good A B testing is heavily dependent on the
[00:14:01,799 -> 00:14:02,440] quality of data.
[00:14:02,440 -> 00:14:03,279] Absolutely. A hundred percent.
[00:14:03,440 -> 00:14:06,799] And for most companies, if they don't have the right infrastructure,
[00:14:06,799 -> 00:14:09,000] they don't have good data quality, then how do they?
[00:14:09,000 -> 00:14:12,600] Yeah, I think garbage in, garbage out, right?
[00:14:12,600 -> 00:14:15,600] So you want to be careful about what you put in.
[00:14:15,600 -> 00:14:21,600] So there are several ways in which we ingest data from our customers.
[00:14:21,600 -> 00:14:26,360] Obviously, if you already have a data warehouse.
[00:14:26,360 -> 00:14:29,639] So we can ingest data directly from whether it's Snowflake,
[00:14:29,639 -> 00:14:32,840] or Redshift, or BigQuery, we can pull that from there.
[00:14:32,840 -> 00:14:37,360] Or the other way is if you have an integration with any kind of
[00:14:37,360 -> 00:14:40,480] like a CDP platform, so segment,
[00:14:40,480 -> 00:14:43,960] or heap, or router stack, or one of those things,
[00:14:43,960 -> 00:14:46,600] you already have a pipe where the data is flowing through,
[00:14:46,600 -> 00:14:48,919] we can also ingest from there.
[00:14:48,919 -> 00:14:50,919] Now, if you don't have any of those already,
[00:14:50,919 -> 00:14:53,519] we make it easy for you to take our SDK
[00:14:53,519 -> 00:14:56,779] and then actually send raw events directly to us.
[00:14:56,779 -> 00:15:01,779] So we make it easy so that the data actually is same
[00:15:02,279 -> 00:15:05,000] and the data is actually valid and not garbage.
[00:15:06,120 -> 00:15:09,559] So whichever path our customers are willing to go,
[00:15:09,559 -> 00:15:11,240] we're happy to go with them.
[00:15:11,240 -> 00:15:15,080] So typically what happens is we do proof of concept
[00:15:15,080 -> 00:15:16,399] with an existing, like you know,
[00:15:16,399 -> 00:15:18,379] if somebody wants to like try and use Statsync,
[00:15:18,379 -> 00:15:19,639] we sit down with them.
[00:15:19,639 -> 00:15:23,759] Our team does a hack on depending on where the data is.
[00:15:23,759 -> 00:15:25,240] And if the data doesn't currently exist,
[00:15:25,240 -> 00:15:28,240] we work with them on integrating our SDK.
[00:15:28,240 -> 00:15:30,720] We take great care in making sure that
[00:15:30,720 -> 00:15:34,000] the data that comes in is actually good data.
[00:15:34,000 -> 00:15:35,200] Because at the end of the day,
[00:15:35,200 -> 00:15:36,440] if we don't get good data,
[00:15:36,440 -> 00:15:38,919] then we're going to tell you all kinds of bad things
[00:15:38,919 -> 00:15:40,860] and it's not good for anyone.
[00:15:40,860 -> 00:15:41,519] All right.
[00:15:41,519 -> 00:15:42,080] Yeah.
[00:15:42,080 -> 00:15:43,720] Okay. Thank you for your time.
[00:15:43,720 -> 00:15:44,919] Cool. Awesome. Well, thank you.
[00:15:44,919 -> 00:15:45,000] Thanks for coming and visiting Statsik. Yeah. Okay. Thank you for your time.
[00:15:45,000 -> 00:15:46,000] Cool.
[00:15:46,000 -> 00:15:47,000] Awesome.
[00:15:47,000 -> 00:15:48,000] Well, thank you.
[00:15:48,000 -> 00:15:49,000] Thanks for coming and visiting Statsik.
[00:15:49,000 -> 00:15:50,000] Yeah.
[00:15:50,000 -> 00:15:52,159] It's very nice to have this opportunity to witness growth.
[00:15:52,159 -> 00:15:59,000] And I wish Statsik becomes very big and can unleash the power of the data science.
[00:15:59,000 -> 00:16:00,000] Thanks.
[00:16:00,000 -> 00:16:01,000] Thanks.
[00:16:01,000 -> 00:16:02,000] I appreciate it.
[00:16:02,000 -> 00:16:03,000] Knock on wood.
[00:16:03,000 -> 00:16:04,879] I hope it comes true.
[00:16:04,879 -> 00:16:05,879] You're welcome again anytime.
[00:16:05,879 -> 00:16:06,879] All right.
[00:16:06,879 -> 00:16:07,879] Thank you.
[00:16:07,879 -> 00:16:08,879] Cool.
[00:16:08,879 -> 00:16:08,899] Thank you.
