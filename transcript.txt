[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,040] Hey, welcome. Thanks. Yeah. YZ. Welcome to my channel. So Nick is a master sommelier
[00:00:07,679 -> 00:00:13,039] that I met how many years ago? Three years ago? I think three years ago. And we became friends. Yes.
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:19,120] Through drinking wine and playing poker. That's right. We have shared some great bottles and
[00:00:19,839 -> 00:00:26,960] good games. Yeah. I do feel like whenever I have wine, my poker game suffers. Me too.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,000] But that's okay. And you've introduced me to a lot of good food too.
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:10,000] Oh yeah. And we had some business collaborations together.
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:15,000] Nick was doing wine consulting and all this.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:20,000] Buying and selling wine, training wine, selection wine, catering.
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:29,000] So today I want to interview you kind of about your take as a master sommelier in the field.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,679] field so I want to just listen to your opinions of what do you think wine is about.
[00:00:07,679 -> 00:00:13,400] So you know for those who are less familiar with the Master Sommelier program it basically
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:22,280] encompasses the world of wine, also spirits, beer, sake, baijiu and I have done intensive
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:09,679] studies to learn about these beverages and am now one of maybe close to 300 in the world.
[00:00:09,679 -> 00:00:15,759] So in a way I'm in a very select group and an expert, but I also look around at other
[00:00:15,759 -> 00:00:23,320] friends who aren't even in the Master Sommelier program with knowledge and business skills
[00:00:23,320 -> 00:00:29,420] and things that just make me look like a beginner.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,560] How do those friends view you?
[00:00:02,560 -> 00:00:07,759] That's a question though because I find myself actually envious sometimes of these guys are
[00:00:07,759 -> 00:00:13,279] drinking these wines and I'm sure plenty of people could look at me and be envious and
[00:00:13,279 -> 00:00:20,879] it's this thing that I think any professional person has to deal with.
[00:00:20,879 -> 00:00:26,339] You know let's say you're the CEO of Honda, are you then going to be jealous of the CEO
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] of Tesla or of GM.
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:12,160] You know, so it's these top achievers sort of looking at each other.
[00:00:12,160 -> 00:00:18,519] But I feel like that's not only in the professions or in the business.
[00:00:18,519 -> 00:00:23,600] Just as anyone, you can always compare yourself to someone else at some dimension and you
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] find someone who is better or that you are invest of.
[00:00:06,160 -> 00:00:10,160] But I guess the motivation of growing, improving
[00:00:10,160 -> 00:00:12,160] comes from looking inward.
[00:00:13,080 -> 00:00:18,079] You feel satisfied or motivated doing the work every day.
[00:00:18,120 -> 00:00:19,600] What motivates you to do the work
[00:00:19,600 -> 00:00:22,800] is a love of the passion about the beverages
[00:00:22,800 -> 00:00:26,519] instead of I need to be better than someone else.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,980] Well, and that's a vision that I've been trying to cultivate is, you know, it's very easy
[00:00:05,980 -> 00:00:11,740] to compare to others, but ultimately, like, my biggest supporter and biggest adversary
[00:00:11,740 -> 00:00:13,619] is myself.
[00:00:13,619 -> 00:00:22,859] Because I have so many visions and ideas of what I want to accomplish that there's no
[00:00:22,859 -> 00:00:25,019] comparing to what anyone else is doing.
[00:00:25,019 -> 00:00:27,480] It's all my own world.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,120] And I think my specialist, my specialty in a way is the selection that I've been building
[00:00:07,120 -> 00:00:16,480] here is one of the most representative selections of wine styles of around the world.
[00:00:16,480 -> 00:00:22,239] Versus some other peers might be like Bordeaux specialists and be very deep in that area.
[00:00:22,239 -> 00:00:27,160] I have in the cellar right now at least a thousand different types of wine.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,019] And with all those styles combined, I feel like I have types from every important wine
[00:00:06,019 -> 00:00:09,839] region in the world, and I'm even finding new ones all the time.
[00:00:09,839 -> 00:00:12,720] So that's what I take pride in.
[00:00:12,720 -> 00:00:13,720] All right.
[00:00:13,720 -> 00:00:20,000] I think I have two kinds of questions or two thesis of questions.
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:24,559] First is this style, this world style, right?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,719] When you select a region and you find the representative bottle of representative variety,
[00:00:07,719 -> 00:00:10,400] what do you mean by being representative?
[00:00:10,400 -> 00:00:18,359] A thousand bottles seems like a lot, but compared to all the bottles out there, it's a very
[00:00:18,359 -> 00:00:19,359] small proportion.
[00:00:19,359 -> 00:00:25,000] Then how do you choose one variety versus the hundreds that you didn't choose?
[00:00:25,000 -> 00:00:27,160] I guess that's number one.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,320] And thesis number two is to talk about your vision and your ideas.
[00:00:04,320 -> 00:00:11,919] Probably this vision and ideas arise from your observation or your experience, you know,
[00:00:11,919 -> 00:00:15,400] something is lacking, there is a problem you want to solve, or there is a value you want
[00:00:15,400 -> 00:00:16,399] to create, right?
[00:00:16,399 -> 00:00:18,780] Or there is a demand you want to fulfill.
[00:00:18,780 -> 00:00:22,920] So if you care to share some of those visions.
[00:00:22,920 -> 00:00:28,539] So in thinking about classic styles from around the world, I think something that might be
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,019] considered a classic is within wine a particular region often has grape
[00:00:05,019 -> 00:00:10,160] varieties that are historic to that place so maybe it's Pinot Noir in
[00:00:10,160 -> 00:00:17,420] Burgundy or Tempranillo in Spain but then going in even deeper there's areas
[00:00:17,420 -> 00:00:22,120] where there are grape varieties that aren't made anywhere else so in Italy we
[00:00:22,120 -> 00:00:29,500] see Biancolela in Lazio or in Argentina we see Bernarda and I'm super
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,839] interested in these very unique little corners of the world and it actually makes me feel
[00:00:05,839 -> 00:00:12,560] connected to the whole world through these little unique points.
[00:00:12,560 -> 00:00:16,980] It's almost like you go to a local, you visit somewhere and there is a place that sells
[00:00:16,980 -> 00:00:20,320] local produce that you cannot get anywhere else.
[00:00:20,320 -> 00:00:25,519] But I guess for one, luckily for us, you can import and we can drink at home.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,799] We don't have to visit that special place, but in this way we feel connected too.
[00:00:04,799 -> 00:00:10,000] Yes, by opening the bottle it transports us to that place for a short amount of time.
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:14,000] I feel like there needs to be an education behind each Schofield bottle.
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:15,000] Oh sure.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:20,000] If I buy some special one from some special region, if I don't know, then I'm missing
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:09,560] out a lot of the special connection or the, yeah, just the experience behind the wine,
[00:00:09,560 -> 00:00:10,560] I guess.
[00:00:10,560 -> 00:00:14,039] I feel like my work is a lot like a DJ.
[00:00:14,039 -> 00:00:17,280] And I have many genres here.
[00:00:17,280 -> 00:00:20,920] It's not just classical, it's not just jazz.
[00:00:20,920 -> 00:00:25,199] You know, I have a few songs from every genre you could think of.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,879] I feel like you are a DJ in a music history class.
[00:00:04,879 -> 00:00:08,980] Yeah, but I, so if I'm only going to have,
[00:00:08,980 -> 00:00:11,619] let's say five reggae songs in the cellar,
[00:00:11,619 -> 00:00:13,359] I want them to be the best.
[00:00:13,359 -> 00:00:14,199] The best.
[00:00:14,199 -> 00:00:15,480] You have to have Bob Marley.
[00:00:15,480 -> 00:00:17,879] But then you can have some modern
[00:00:17,879 -> 00:00:19,440] kind of new versions as well.
[00:00:19,440 -> 00:00:20,280] I see.
[00:00:20,280 -> 00:00:22,920] But I'm very interested in having the classics
[00:00:22,920 -> 00:00:27,039] juxtaposed against some modern styles as well.
[00:00:27,039 -> 00:00:27,859] I see.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,359] And over the time, the wine list you build,
[00:00:03,359 -> 00:00:06,919] the selection you have in here becomes very special.
[00:00:06,919 -> 00:00:10,000] It's your selection and it represents your take
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:14,560] on what is the best and what is worthy
[00:00:14,560 -> 00:00:19,559] of being represented, I guess being, yeah, worthy.
[00:00:20,519 -> 00:00:22,839] It becomes more than just individual bottles.
[00:00:22,839 -> 00:00:26,039] The collection itself, to me, has a personality.
[00:00:26,039 -> 00:00:26,879] Nice.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,240] this this kind of library or catalog in itself it reflects my creativity.
[00:00:06,240 -> 00:00:07,240] Okay.
[00:00:07,240 -> 00:00:15,199] What's really neat about a lot of the wines that I have is that I may have the last, it's
[00:00:15,199 -> 00:00:20,440] like the last dinosaur, I may have the last of a certain kind of wine in the whole country.
[00:00:20,440 -> 00:00:23,559] And I think that's super cool.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,540] everything in here I find to be of superior taste as well. Something that
[00:00:05,540 -> 00:00:10,080] would be enjoyable for me any day of the week.
[00:00:10,080 -> 00:00:15,080] Okay, let's dig into that a little bit. Because when people, like newbies like me,
[00:00:15,080 -> 00:00:20,679] when we look into a wine, we don't know a lot of the history or the
[00:00:20,679 -> 00:00:25,600] making, the processing of the wine. We are seeking that education but
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,080] we don't have enough knowledge.
[00:00:02,080 -> 00:00:05,360] So the first two things I guess we think about
[00:00:05,360 -> 00:00:08,720] is the price and how it tastes.
[00:00:11,640 -> 00:00:14,759] So apparently you select the wine
[00:00:14,759 -> 00:00:17,079] that you think tastes well, right?
[00:00:17,079 -> 00:00:19,640] But how do you judge?
[00:00:19,640 -> 00:00:21,719] Because for example for me,
[00:00:21,719 -> 00:00:24,440] at the beginning I only liked fruity wines.
[00:00:24,440 -> 00:00:26,640] And then I like wine with strong body.
[00:00:26,640 -> 00:00:29,679] And then you introduce me to the world of natural wines.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,799] At the beginning I feel like, oh, how weird, right?
[00:00:04,799 -> 00:00:07,320] But then I feel like, okay, this is what the wine
[00:00:07,320 -> 00:00:11,519] naturally becomes and I learn to appreciate those flavors.
[00:00:11,519 -> 00:00:13,960] So the taste varies by individual,
[00:00:13,960 -> 00:00:17,960] but I feel like it's also being able to be educated.
[00:00:18,879 -> 00:00:23,239] The exposure over time is how we learn.
[00:00:23,239 -> 00:00:27,679] Imagine a baby who's never seen certain colors before,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,280] It sees orange for the first time and it makes a big impression.
[00:00:04,280 -> 00:00:10,619] A lot of people when it comes to wine only know like blue, red, and yellow.
[00:00:10,619 -> 00:00:12,820] Those are the only colors they know.
[00:00:12,820 -> 00:00:18,500] And that's like maybe they only know Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and Chardonnay.
[00:00:18,500 -> 00:00:25,339] And my perspective is I have all the colors of the rainbow and all the variations of the
[00:00:25,339 -> 00:00:28,699] colors and all the different textures and everything.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:08,759] So that's just because of exposure for maybe 10 years trying 20,000 different wines a year
[00:00:08,759 -> 00:00:14,460] and building up this sort of taste memory.
[00:00:14,460 -> 00:00:20,559] And for those who aren't able to taste that many wines, I would still encourage them to
[00:00:20,559 -> 00:00:25,679] find some favorites and always try new things too.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,040] That is a very important dimension.
[00:00:02,040 -> 00:00:04,440] I always want to try new wines.
[00:00:04,440 -> 00:00:10,800] But if I try, for example, a thousand bottles of Yellowtail, I won't be able to tell very
[00:00:10,800 -> 00:00:11,800] much.
[00:00:11,800 -> 00:00:12,800] Right.
[00:00:12,800 -> 00:00:16,280] Then, like, there must be some, a lot of bottles.
[00:00:16,280 -> 00:00:21,920] Like we know each wine is unique and has its own, like, flavor.
[00:00:21,920 -> 00:00:26,000] But there must be some better wines and worse wines, right?
[00:00:26,000 -> 00:00:28,000] Oh, without question.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,480] And how do you tell?
[00:00:02,480 -> 00:00:06,719] How do you decide this bottle tastes good and that bottle doesn't taste good?
[00:00:06,719 -> 00:00:16,719] I don't think it requires a lot of heavy cognition to decide if something tastes good or not.
[00:00:16,719 -> 00:00:18,579] It's kind of an instant thing.
[00:00:18,579 -> 00:00:24,379] It's kind of like when you taste something that reminds me of your childhood, that feeling
[00:00:24,379 -> 00:00:26,339] of nostalgia is instant.
[00:00:26,339 -> 00:00:27,839] It doesn't require you to think about it.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,280] So the thing about our taste is that our preferences evolve over time.
[00:00:05,280 -> 00:00:11,359] So the wines that I may have enjoyed five years ago, I probably still like, but maybe
[00:00:11,359 -> 00:00:17,679] the wines that I first enjoyed ten years ago, I kind of graduate through to different styles
[00:00:17,679 -> 00:00:21,000] and I'm in the mood for different things.
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:22,000] Same thing with music.
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:27,160] I find myself listening to some genres for like three months straight and then I'll switch
[00:00:27,160 -> 00:00:29,859] and go to something else.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,960] So I think our tastes do evolve and change over time.
[00:00:03,960 -> 00:00:11,199] But yeah, as far as like what's good, there's trends, there's things that are popular to
[00:00:11,199 -> 00:00:13,660] the general public.
[00:00:13,660 -> 00:00:19,600] But if we think about what's good, you think about with foods, most people start with things
[00:00:19,600 -> 00:00:21,480] that are sweet.
[00:00:21,480 -> 00:00:24,960] Most children hate, yeah, sweet things.
[00:00:24,960 -> 00:00:28,420] Most children hate bitter and sour.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,759] So usually the first wines that most people start with are soft, sweet wines.
[00:00:06,759 -> 00:00:15,080] And then as time goes on, we can develop an appreciation for sour and bitter and grow
[00:00:15,080 -> 00:00:21,079] to understand, you know, let's say Italian wines can be very bitter or, you know, certain
[00:00:21,079 -> 00:00:23,640] white wines can be quite sour.
[00:00:23,640 -> 00:00:28,719] And they can be displeasing at first if you're not used to it, but then you grow to like
[00:00:28,719 -> 00:00:29,719] it.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] bitter melon as a vegetable.
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,000] I'm not used to bitter melon yet,
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:06,000] but some people are used to it and love it.
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:08,000] Even tea, or
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:10,000] beer, at the beginning all you taste
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:12,000] is bitterness, but over time you can
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,000] tell this is oolong, this is
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:16,000] red tea, and over time
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:18,000] you can tell this is good quality oolong.
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:20,000] I like this kind of
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:22,000] you don't taste the bitterness anymore,
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:24,000] you just taste the quality or
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:26,000] the goodness.
[00:00:26,000 -> 00:00:28,000] I do
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] I do find whenever you brought wine, I end up drinking the wine very happily.
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:14,000] The taste can vary, but the feeling after drinking it is just, you know, I feel wholesome or whatever.
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:16,000] It just feels good.
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:24,000] But versus some commercial, even sometimes those wines can be very expensive, and I don't feel good after drinking those.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,000] Like not body feeling, like it's not headache or anything, but just you don't feel satisfied, I guess.
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:15,000] I think it can be compared with foods to things that are mass market processed foods versus home cooked ingredients.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:21,000] And a lot of the great wines that I enjoy are not made in large quantities.
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:28,000] They're made on the scale of, let's say, 5,000 to 50,000 bottles per year by the winery.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,440] Many commercial wines that are found in the grocery store
[00:00:04,440 -> 00:00:06,879] would be made in the hundreds of thousands
[00:00:06,879 -> 00:00:08,439] to millions of bottles per year.
[00:00:08,439 -> 00:00:13,320] So when getting to that more, it's more family farms,
[00:00:13,320 -> 00:00:18,320] family wineries, they are making wine that isn't,
[00:00:19,160 -> 00:00:23,920] doesn't have to be consistent across a million bottles.
[00:00:23,920 -> 00:00:26,679] It only has to be consistent across, let's say 10,000.
[00:00:26,679 -> 00:00:29,719] And when that scale is smaller,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,879] the quality is just going to be higher.
[00:00:02,879 -> 00:00:03,799] Yeah.
[00:00:03,799 -> 00:00:07,960] Speaking of quality, we can go to the second factor, price.
[00:00:07,960 -> 00:00:08,800] Right.
[00:00:09,679 -> 00:00:12,400] What's the average or median?
[00:00:12,400 -> 00:00:16,559] What's the median price of a selection?
[00:00:16,559 -> 00:00:20,440] You know, so speaking in US dollars, I would say $50.
[00:00:21,359 -> 00:00:24,480] Retail for a bottle would be the median.
[00:00:25,320 -> 00:00:28,239] I do have many selections that are in the 20s,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,560] and then I have some that are in the thousands as well.
[00:00:03,560 -> 00:00:08,080] But I am thinking of most days,
[00:00:08,080 -> 00:00:10,960] if I wanna drink a wine that has a lot of energy
[00:00:10,960 -> 00:00:13,199] and personality, I'm probably gonna reach
[00:00:13,199 -> 00:00:15,279] for something that's 40 to $60.
[00:00:16,199 -> 00:00:18,120] And that's where I'm at right now.
[00:00:20,120 -> 00:00:22,120] I didn't start at that level
[00:00:22,120 -> 00:00:23,280] when I was first getting into wine.
[00:00:23,280 -> 00:00:26,160] I was in the 10, 15, $20 level,
[00:00:26,160 -> 00:00:28,440] and I think most people should stay there.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,639] and there's a lot of great wines,
[00:00:01,639 -> 00:00:04,559] let's say in the 20s to 30s,
[00:00:04,559 -> 00:00:08,720] that's where quality is...
[00:00:08,720 -> 00:00:09,560] Possible.
[00:00:09,560 -> 00:00:10,720] Takes a big jump.
[00:00:10,720 -> 00:00:11,679] It takes a, okay.
[00:00:11,679 -> 00:00:15,919] Then the quality from 30 to 50, it's a smaller jump.
[00:00:15,919 -> 00:00:17,559] And then the quality from 50 to 100,
[00:00:17,559 -> 00:00:19,399] it's really not much of a jump.
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:24,079] And above 100, quality, it really does taper off.
[00:00:24,079 -> 00:00:29,079] So I think if people can get to like a $30 bottle,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,359] That's where you can get amazing wine from anywhere in the world.
[00:00:03,359 -> 00:00:07,200] And these wines that end up being super expensive are...
[00:00:07,200 -> 00:00:10,679] they're priced like that because of
[00:00:10,679 -> 00:00:15,320] rarity and market demand, but it's not because of quality necessarily.
[00:00:15,320 -> 00:00:19,039] Shit. Because when I drink wine from China,
[00:00:19,039 -> 00:00:22,280] it's very difficult to get a good bottle
[00:00:22,280 -> 00:00:26,320] with 30 US dollars. Like usually you have to go to
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:11,000] like $1800-$200. Yeah, I think the economics of taxes and getting the wine there, market
[00:00:11,000 -> 00:00:20,440] to mine, yeah, it's, we probably have an advantage in the States and in Europe it's even cheaper.
[00:00:20,440 -> 00:00:26,199] Especially right now, right? Yeah. You're going down to half price. So let's take Burgundy
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:10,519] for example, I could get a really great Burgundy wine, let's say Louis Jadot Merceau here in
[00:00:10,519 -> 00:00:14,560] the United States for retail $75.
[00:00:14,560 -> 00:00:19,800] In China it's probably double or triple and in Europe it might be half.
[00:00:19,800 -> 00:00:28,440] So you know, part of it's shipping, part of it is tax and then availability, demand.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,500] So it's so interesting that the same bottle of wine can cost so many different prices
[00:00:06,500 -> 00:00:07,500] around the world.
[00:00:07,500 -> 00:00:08,500] Yeah, okay.
[00:00:08,500 -> 00:00:14,500] But I guess in order to get good quality, good value wine, just check out your website.
[00:00:14,500 -> 00:00:15,500] Yeah.
[00:00:15,500 -> 00:00:17,539] You should be anywhere in the United States, right?
[00:00:17,539 -> 00:00:22,260] Anywhere in the United States and then sometimes I can do international too.
[00:00:22,260 -> 00:00:23,260] Nice.
[00:00:23,260 -> 00:00:25,379] I should bring a case back home.
[00:00:25,379 -> 00:00:26,379] You should.
[00:00:26,379 -> 00:00:27,379] If I can.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,279] if I can. I don't think, yeah, the logistic is just not a memory.
[00:00:03,279 -> 00:00:04,320] That's a bit complicated.
[00:00:04,320 -> 00:00:13,519] Yeah. Okay, so your style is the representative of kind of a world history of wine.
[00:00:14,240 -> 00:00:14,640] Sure.
[00:00:14,640 -> 00:00:18,239] Yeah. And taste, quality.
[00:00:18,239 -> 00:00:22,800] The oldest bottle, the oldest bottle I have right now is from 1875.
[00:00:23,440 -> 00:00:25,280] 1875, wow.
[00:00:25,280 -> 00:00:27,679] Yeah, that's a Madeira wine from Portugal.
[00:00:27,679 -> 00:00:29,280] Still Madeira wine.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,279] Oh yeah, and it should still be delicious.
[00:00:02,279 -> 00:00:04,759] And then the youngest wine would be 2021.
[00:00:04,759 -> 00:00:10,599] So, you know, a long history there,
[00:00:10,599 -> 00:00:13,519] almost 150 years of history.
[00:00:13,519 -> 00:00:16,120] So, that's pretty cool, huh?
[00:00:16,120 -> 00:00:17,320] Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:17,320 -> 00:00:19,559] Definitely worth checking out your wine list.
[00:00:19,559 -> 00:00:20,199] Sure.
[00:00:20,199 -> 00:00:21,679] Is it updated for all those?
[00:00:21,679 -> 00:00:23,280] Yeah, I try to update it every week.
[00:00:23,280 -> 00:00:27,719] And that's a whole task to itself.
[00:00:27,719 -> 00:00:28,920] But you enjoy doing so.
[00:00:28,920 -> 00:00:29,679] I enjoy it.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,440] It's sort of my, yeah, it's hard to say like my life's work,
[00:00:04,440 -> 00:00:08,560] but it's something that I've become good at
[00:00:08,560 -> 00:00:12,400] and keeps me energized, keeps my creativity going.
[00:00:13,160 -> 00:00:14,640] Nice.
[00:00:14,640 -> 00:00:18,559] Okay, let's go to the second phase of my questions.
[00:00:18,559 -> 00:00:21,120] You have been doing your own business,
[00:00:21,120 -> 00:00:24,199] unlike a lot of your colleagues,
[00:00:24,199 -> 00:00:27,640] and you deal with customers firsthand,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,279] you deal with shipping, you deal with import first hand.
[00:00:03,279 -> 00:00:05,679] What do you feel like is lacking
[00:00:05,679 -> 00:00:08,400] or what do you want to fulfill?
[00:00:08,400 -> 00:00:11,679] Like where do you want to create value in this industry?
[00:00:11,679 -> 00:00:13,960] Other than what you have been doing right now.
[00:00:13,960 -> 00:00:17,519] Yeah, I mean, I think there are all these
[00:00:17,519 -> 00:00:19,219] different relationships that you've described.
[00:00:19,219 -> 00:00:21,800] I have my client relationships,
[00:00:21,800 -> 00:00:24,519] the different suppliers that I work with,
[00:00:24,519 -> 00:00:28,280] the wineries themselves, and then kind of the broader
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,359] audience of people who've never even bought wine from me,
[00:00:03,359 -> 00:00:07,160] but watch the posts and have followed my journey.
[00:00:07,160 -> 00:00:10,919] So I think one vision I'd like to do into the future
[00:00:10,919 -> 00:00:15,919] is to somehow tie that together and offer more resources,
[00:00:16,079 -> 00:00:19,559] maybe on video or audio,
[00:00:19,559 -> 00:00:23,000] just how I can share what it is that I do
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:24,559] and share my passion.
[00:00:24,559 -> 00:00:26,899] I'm a bit self-conscious
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,839] and it's not always easy for me to want to put out an idea
[00:00:04,839 -> 00:00:09,000] for fear of the natural criticism that might happen.
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:12,160] Yeah, and there is always criticism.
[00:00:13,199 -> 00:00:14,880] Even if 100 people likes you,
[00:00:14,880 -> 00:00:19,760] and it takes one criticism to destroy our mood
[00:00:19,760 -> 00:00:21,280] and destroy our motivation.
[00:00:21,280 -> 00:00:25,739] And we have that negative bias where if we have 99 likes
[00:00:25,739 -> 00:00:29,239] and one thumbs down, the thumbs down,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,000] It stands out and it's what I might remember all day long.
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:07,400] So I think it's important.
[00:00:07,400 -> 00:00:09,960] I think any creator has to deal with that.
[00:00:11,320 -> 00:00:13,560] But when I'm here in the cellar by myself,
[00:00:13,560 -> 00:00:15,359] there's no one criticizing.
[00:00:15,359 -> 00:00:18,300] It's just me and my work and my headphones in
[00:00:18,300 -> 00:00:20,500] and all the bottles, my little friends here.
[00:00:22,480 -> 00:00:25,640] So I guess content is education
[00:00:25,640 -> 00:00:29,280] and just introducing people to like other
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,400] Nice things behind. Yeah, I mean I think it'd be interesting to talk about the wines of course.
[00:00:05,400 -> 00:00:09,199] I'd also like to talk about how I do my work.
[00:00:09,199 -> 00:00:13,400] How, like educate on how I developed my inventory system.
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:21,100] Or how I do the shipping. How to wrap a bottle and send it to Singapore and have it show up in one piece.
[00:00:21,100 -> 00:00:26,800] How to negotiate doing the sales part. So all these behind the scenes things that I've just had to learn on my own.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,400] There was no one that really taught me in a package deal.
[00:00:04,400 -> 00:00:07,400] So that could be something that would be unique.
[00:00:07,400 -> 00:00:09,400] Because there's plenty of people out there who say,
[00:00:09,400 -> 00:00:13,699] oh, this is what Pinot Noir is, or this is what Chardonnay is,
[00:00:13,699 -> 00:00:15,000] and how they taste.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:20,300] But there's not too many that tie it all together with a business mindset.
[00:00:20,300 -> 00:00:24,199] I see. Maybe you can franchise a business someday.
[00:00:24,199 -> 00:00:25,000] Who knows? Yeah.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,080] But I mean, I follow a lot of content creators
[00:00:03,080 -> 00:00:06,080] and really enjoy whatever they have to say.
[00:00:06,080 -> 00:00:07,839] And I don't always watch all their videos
[00:00:07,839 -> 00:00:09,500] and some I like better than others,
[00:00:09,500 -> 00:00:13,679] but I do think that creators can add a lot of value
[00:00:13,679 -> 00:00:17,000] and just expand ideas.
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:19,839] One of the channels on YouTube that I started watching
[00:00:19,839 -> 00:00:22,160] was called Wristwatch Revival.
[00:00:22,160 -> 00:00:24,199] And it's this guy who takes apart
[00:00:24,199 -> 00:00:28,160] antique mechanical wristwatches, cleans them,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,080] puts them back together, makes sure they're running.
[00:00:02,080 -> 00:00:04,200] And I'm not gonna become a watchmaker,
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:07,160] but I really like the process.
[00:00:07,160 -> 00:00:08,599] And I think there's a lot of people
[00:00:08,599 -> 00:00:10,060] who aren't even into wine,
[00:00:10,060 -> 00:00:12,640] who would enjoy the process of what I do.
[00:00:12,640 -> 00:00:13,480] Nice.
[00:00:14,439 -> 00:00:16,120] Maybe I can just lend you my camera
[00:00:16,120 -> 00:00:18,559] and we can film all day.
[00:00:18,559 -> 00:00:20,640] But editing videos,
[00:00:20,640 -> 00:00:23,719] if you enjoy editing videos, then that would be great.
[00:00:23,719 -> 00:00:25,519] Right, that's a lot of work.
[00:00:25,519 -> 00:00:29,000] It's not too much, but still it takes,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,000] Like you are already very busy, so.
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:03,839] Yeah, well.
[00:00:04,879 -> 00:00:09,800] But yeah, like if someone is interested in watching
[00:00:09,800 -> 00:00:11,640] or creating this kind of content,
[00:00:11,640 -> 00:00:14,240] maybe we can reach out to you.
[00:00:14,240 -> 00:00:17,559] Yeah, it'd be fun to partner with someone
[00:00:17,559 -> 00:00:20,600] who wants to do the production side.
[00:00:20,600 -> 00:00:23,039] And I could be the talking head.
[00:00:23,039 -> 00:00:24,920] Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:24,920 -> 00:00:26,679] And they can just hide and delete
[00:00:26,679 -> 00:00:28,440] all the negative comments for you.
[00:00:28,440 -> 00:00:29,280] That's right.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] I don't have to see him.
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,360] Well, it's like Johnny Depp.
[00:00:04,360 -> 00:00:07,320] I saw a quote that he said that he makes his movies,
[00:00:07,320 -> 00:00:09,960] but he never watches his own movies.
[00:00:09,960 -> 00:00:14,439] So I'd be interested to like talk and make the content,
[00:00:14,439 -> 00:00:16,440] but then not even watch it.
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:21,199] In terms of the industry, so this is,
[00:00:21,199 -> 00:00:24,039] you started this and you feel like
[00:00:24,039 -> 00:00:27,019] if you just tell people the process
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,319] or tell people, show people what to do,
[00:00:03,640 -> 00:00:08,380] it would be useful at least to you three years ago.
[00:00:09,519 -> 00:00:12,599] It would be, and maybe I'm giving away secrets and IP,
[00:00:12,599 -> 00:00:15,000] but you know what, who cares?
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:17,440] If you can encourage more people to be in this business,
[00:00:17,440 -> 00:00:19,179] I think it's a good thing.
[00:00:19,179 -> 00:00:20,019] Yeah.
[00:00:20,019 -> 00:00:22,079] Even if you create more competitors still.
[00:00:22,079 -> 00:00:26,719] I feel like the demand is much higher than Phoenix.
[00:00:26,719 -> 00:00:29,719] You know, let's say the knowledge and tools that I have,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,140] it's like I have a really good hammer
[00:00:02,140 -> 00:00:04,080] and I might wanna keep this hammer to myself
[00:00:04,080 -> 00:00:06,599] because I'm able to build really well with it.
[00:00:06,599 -> 00:00:08,519] Well, just release the hammer
[00:00:08,519 -> 00:00:11,000] and ultimately whoever works the hardest
[00:00:11,000 -> 00:00:13,779] is going to build the best house.
[00:00:13,779 -> 00:00:15,480] So it's not just having the tools,
[00:00:15,480 -> 00:00:20,480] it's showing up every day and doing it rain or shine.
[00:00:21,539 -> 00:00:23,699] So I think that's the separator.
[00:00:24,640 -> 00:00:26,039] So just put the knowledge out there
[00:00:26,039 -> 00:00:28,879] and those who are willing to work,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,559] they'll make use of it and I'm not worried about losing something by sharing.
[00:00:07,559 -> 00:00:08,560] Sure.
[00:00:08,560 -> 00:00:09,560] Yeah.
[00:00:09,560 -> 00:00:10,560] Okay.
[00:00:10,560 -> 00:00:11,560] Yeah.
[00:00:11,560 -> 00:00:12,560] That's one thing.
[00:00:12,560 -> 00:00:14,679] And about the industry, anything else?
[00:00:14,679 -> 00:00:21,199] You feel like there is an unsatisfied demand for wine consumers that you really want to
[00:00:21,199 -> 00:00:22,199] ...
[00:00:22,199 -> 00:00:23,199] There are.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] I
[00:00:02,759 -> 00:00:04,759] Think there are millions of people who are
[00:00:05,879 -> 00:00:08,039] interested in eager and getting into wines and
[00:00:08,720 -> 00:00:11,359] I think there are enough wines that
[00:00:12,300 -> 00:00:14,359] Everyone can have but what?
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:20,719] sometimes happens is as soon as someone gets in a wine they want to get the rare collectible wines and
[00:00:21,559 -> 00:00:25,440] I think a lot of people a lot of the clients that I've seen
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,799] seen come and go are just interested in like,
[00:00:03,799 -> 00:00:06,799] oh, I have this one last bottle of something
[00:00:06,799 -> 00:00:10,839] and they want that trophy.
[00:00:10,839 -> 00:00:13,119] And then they move on to the next merchant
[00:00:13,119 -> 00:00:14,839] who has the next trophy.
[00:00:14,839 -> 00:00:18,440] So I think I would like to encourage
[00:00:18,440 -> 00:00:21,079] not just chasing the trophy wines,
[00:00:21,079 -> 00:00:25,120] but getting into, you know,
[00:00:25,120 -> 00:00:28,219] wine regardless of its sort of mystique.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,600] So that's like the ultra collectors who are into that.
[00:00:02,600 -> 00:00:06,059] And then there's people who have never tasted wine at all.
[00:00:06,059 -> 00:00:08,179] And there's a big chasm in between.
[00:00:08,179 -> 00:00:10,279] The big chasm in between.
[00:00:10,279 -> 00:00:13,599] I also feel this because before I met you,
[00:00:14,519 -> 00:00:17,000] I think she is the one who introduced me
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:19,600] to the world of like final quality,
[00:00:19,600 -> 00:00:21,679] but not so expensive wines.
[00:00:21,679 -> 00:00:23,539] And you are the one who really, you know,
[00:00:23,539 -> 00:00:26,640] showed me a lot and helped me do all the collections
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] and had me really enjoy nice wines for a couple years.
[00:00:06,360 -> 00:00:08,480] But without knowing you,
[00:00:08,480 -> 00:00:12,720] I feel like I would be stuck in the place of, you know,
[00:00:12,720 -> 00:00:17,480] drinking Whole Foods or Trader Joe's or Costco wine
[00:00:17,480 -> 00:00:20,120] and never being able to be exposed
[00:00:20,120 -> 00:00:23,480] to the good things out there.
[00:00:23,480 -> 00:00:25,280] I know, and it's tricky because
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:09,000] I ultimately don't know how to scale my business to the same reach of someone like a Whole Foods or a Costco.
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:16,000] They have all the logistics in place and good quality wines for the masses.
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:24,000] But I'm kind of a one-stop shop in terms of the products I can offer, but I think the knowledge I can offer could scale.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:11,960] But I think that if someone has the knowledge of 20 classic wines, that could be empowering.
[00:00:11,960 -> 00:00:14,679] It's just like with someone who is interested in cocktails.
[00:00:14,679 -> 00:00:19,960] If someone knows 20 classic cocktail recipes, they know cocktails.
[00:00:19,960 -> 00:00:25,199] So I think it'd be interesting, I'm just sort of riffing on this idea, of maybe come up
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] with a list of what are the 20 most important wine styles in the world that
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:12,679] someone could learn about and maybe list 10 options of each style. So it would be
[00:00:12,679 -> 00:00:18,239] maybe 200 different bottles. But yeah, what are the 20
[00:00:18,239 -> 00:00:24,539] wines that define the wine world right now and that's attainable for someone to
[00:00:24,539 -> 00:00:29,839] learn? Yeah, there was one cocktail book I really enjoyed. You know the book, but
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,399] I forgot the name. It's a square book with a lot of pictures.
[00:00:03,399 -> 00:00:04,400] Okay.
[00:00:04,400 -> 00:00:06,200] And they start with the six basic styles.
[00:00:06,200 -> 00:00:09,199] Right. Maybe it's liquid intelligence. Is that it?
[00:00:09,199 -> 00:00:10,199] No.
[00:00:10,199 -> 00:00:11,199] Okay.
[00:00:11,199 -> 00:00:14,000] It's a different... I'll find it and I'll put it on the screen.
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:15,000] Yeah.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:22,600] But it's six basic styles and all the derivations based on those six basic styles.
[00:00:22,600 -> 00:00:23,600] Totally.
[00:00:23,600 -> 00:00:24,600] Yeah.
[00:00:24,600 -> 00:00:29,000] So, you know, in the wine world, Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, that would be on the list.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,000] For sure.
[00:00:01,000 -> 00:00:07,160] Napa Valley Charbonneau would not be on that list.
[00:00:07,160 -> 00:00:08,519] It's too niche.
[00:00:08,519 -> 00:00:14,560] So focus on the classics and explain why they're classics.
[00:00:14,560 -> 00:00:22,079] And then every other type of wine that's out there is sort of an easy reference point from
[00:00:22,079 -> 00:00:23,079] that basis.
[00:00:23,079 -> 00:00:29,960] Yeah, I feel like once you introduce the classics, then you can connect the dots, find linkages.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,000] Yes.
[00:00:01,000 -> 00:00:02,000] Yeah, right.
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:03,000] The history of Kubernetes and VL.
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,000] Right.
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:06,759] And, you know, how it compares to different Kubernetes and VL.
[00:00:06,759 -> 00:00:11,839] And then the knowledge expands and you have a whole world to explore for yourself.
[00:00:11,839 -> 00:00:13,439] It's super interesting idea.
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:14,439] Okay.
[00:00:14,439 -> 00:00:15,439] Nice.
[00:00:15,439 -> 00:00:16,440] Nice.
[00:00:16,440 -> 00:00:17,440] All right.
[00:00:17,440 -> 00:00:18,440] Anything else?
[00:00:18,440 -> 00:00:20,559] That's all I got for now.
[00:00:20,559 -> 00:00:21,559] Okay.
[00:00:21,559 -> 00:00:22,559] Short and sweet.
[00:00:22,559 -> 00:00:23,559] Okay.
[00:00:23,559 -> 00:00:24,559] Thank you, Nick.
[00:00:24,559 -> 00:00:25,559] Thank you.
[00:00:25,559 -> 00:00:26,879] Congratulations on the business growing year by year.
[00:00:26,879 -> 00:00:27,879] Well, thank you for your support.
[00:00:27,879 -> 00:00:28,879] Yeah.
[00:00:28,879 -> 00:00:29,879] Appreciate it, Wai-Z.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:00,500] Bye.
[00:00:00,500 -> 00:00:01,000] Bye-bye.
