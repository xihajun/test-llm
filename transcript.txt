[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,360] I think it's important that you're always trying to, you know, change and grow and become
[00:00:04,639 -> 00:00:08,679] Yeah, for me, I like to order different stuff. I always go for the
[00:00:09,960 -> 00:00:11,960] For the dish that I haven't tried before
[00:00:12,359 -> 00:00:16,859] So I don't like exactly yeah, even for wine like even I know I like this wine a lot
[00:00:16,859 -> 00:00:20,519] I always want to try a different bottle and would you say
[00:00:22,199 -> 00:00:26,899] This is abnormal in China or maybe you're influenced from America or
[00:00:26,899 -> 00:00:28,980] is this just your personality in general?
[00:00:28,980 -> 00:00:29,980] I don't know.
[00:00:29,980 -> 00:00:33,420] Maybe it's the 88 kids, you know?
[00:00:33,420 -> 00:00:34,420] Maybe.
[00:00:34,420 -> 00:00:36,219] AD, what about you?
[00:00:36,219 -> 00:00:38,460] Do you like to try new stuff?
[00:00:38,460 -> 00:00:41,939] I always like to try new stuff.
[00:00:41,939 -> 00:00:44,380] He's spent a lot of time traveling as well.
[00:00:44,380 -> 00:00:49,000] For example, last night my favorite dish was the asparagus because it was new.
[00:00:49,000 -> 00:00:50,000] Really?
[00:00:50,000 -> 00:00:51,000] Yeah.
[00:00:51,000 -> 00:00:52,000] What about your friends?
[00:00:52,000 -> 00:00:53,000] Everyone likes to try new stuff.
[00:00:53,000 -> 00:00:59,799] They don't like to taste the same food over and over again.
[00:00:59,799 -> 00:01:03,799] So the one signature dish or several signature dishes that neverâ€¦
[00:01:03,799 -> 00:01:05,359] The signature dish is a different story.
[00:01:05,359 -> 00:01:11,359] If it's really good, and it's really associated with the restaurant,
[00:01:11,359 -> 00:01:13,359] they would want to taste it when they're here.
[00:01:13,359 -> 00:01:16,359] But would they go back to taste it again?
[00:01:16,359 -> 00:01:20,359] Yeah. But not with the exact same menu as before.
[00:01:20,359 -> 00:01:23,359] One signature dish and different combinations.
[00:01:23,359 -> 00:01:27,519] So maybe that's our way of doing pairing.
[00:01:27,519 -> 00:01:31,200] Maybe that's also our way of why we like control.
[00:01:31,200 -> 00:01:41,200] Because for people who are very aesthetic in ordering Chinese food, the ordering is
[00:01:41,200 -> 00:01:51,120] part of the creation. The way, how you order different dishes, how you choose to combine them, and also the sequence
[00:01:51,120 -> 00:01:57,879] of presenting the food is very essential to the whole experience.
[00:01:57,879 -> 00:02:03,799] And someone who knows how to order would have a very different effect.
[00:02:03,799 -> 00:02:05,680] In our restaurant, we also choose for them.
[00:02:05,680 -> 00:02:08,919] For example, we make sure when they come next time,
[00:02:08,919 -> 00:02:11,240] they don't have the exact same menu as last time.
[00:02:11,240 -> 00:02:12,680] But we just choose for them.
[00:02:12,680 -> 00:02:17,599] Yeah, but I think, and this is what kind of AdWord
[00:02:17,599 -> 00:02:19,840] enlightened me to the local preferences,
[00:02:19,840 -> 00:02:24,360] is that we can change some, and you can choose some dishes
[00:02:24,360 -> 00:02:26,000] for them, but they also need to have some choice.
[00:02:26,000 -> 00:02:29,000] That's why we have these supplements now.
[00:02:29,000 -> 00:02:34,000] I offer the signature dish as an option, but I never put it on the main menu.
[00:02:34,000 -> 00:02:36,000] What's the signature dish?
[00:02:36,000 -> 00:02:38,000] The chicken. It's not mine.
[00:02:38,000 -> 00:02:40,000] Oh, yeah, the hot chicken.
[00:02:40,000 -> 00:02:41,000] Sourdough.
[00:02:41,000 -> 00:02:46,159] Yeah, so if guests come and they love the signature dish,
[00:02:46,159 -> 00:02:48,159] or they want to show it to a friend or something,
[00:02:48,159 -> 00:02:48,840] they can order it.
[00:02:48,840 -> 00:02:52,080] But the menu doesn't have that anymore.
[00:02:52,080 -> 00:02:56,039] Because I was getting sick of cooking the same thing.
[00:02:56,039 -> 00:02:58,639] I wanted to keep trying new stuff.
[00:02:58,639 -> 00:03:01,560] Yeah, I think it's actually a good balance.
[00:03:01,560 -> 00:03:02,479] It's not on the menu.
[00:03:02,479 -> 00:03:10,000] It's actually a good balance. It's not on the menu, it's still available. So only people who, you know, people would even, the people who order this dish for the
[00:03:10,000 -> 00:03:14,000] privileged experience would even feel more, even more privileged.
[00:03:14,000 -> 00:03:16,000] Right, right. Exactly.
[00:03:16,000 -> 00:03:17,000] In the know.
[00:03:17,000 -> 00:03:18,000] Yeah.
[00:03:18,000 -> 00:03:19,000] Yeah.
[00:03:19,000 -> 00:03:31,080] There was one question prepared before, and I think it's time to ask that question. Because you are a foreigner coming to China to do Chinese food.
[00:03:31,080 -> 00:03:32,080] I don't say Chinese food.
[00:03:32,080 -> 00:03:33,080] Am I doing Chinese food?
[00:03:33,080 -> 00:03:35,400] You always said last night you were doing Cantonese food.
[00:03:35,400 -> 00:03:37,039] No, no, that's from the article.
[00:03:37,039 -> 00:03:41,159] The article says you are more than Cantonese and you agreed to the term because you didn't
[00:03:41,159 -> 00:03:47,000] like the word fusion. I didn't create that word.
[00:03:47,000 -> 00:03:49,000] Some guests that come in say,
[00:03:49,000 -> 00:03:52,000] oh, you're kind of like a modern Cantonese restaurant.
[00:03:52,000 -> 00:03:54,000] And when guests tell me that,
[00:03:54,000 -> 00:03:57,000] I like it. I like it much more than,
[00:03:57,000 -> 00:03:59,000] oh, I like your fusion concepts.
[00:03:59,000 -> 00:04:01,000] Yeah, me too.
[00:04:01,000 -> 00:04:03,000] I think it's kind of cool because it's...
[00:04:03,000 -> 00:04:08,000] Only that I don't view it as modern Cantonese, I view it as modern Chinese.
[00:04:08,000 -> 00:04:09,000] Yeah.
[00:04:09,000 -> 00:04:15,000] And the reason I say that is because you use Chinese ingredients, you use Chinese seasoning,
[00:04:15,000 -> 00:04:22,000] maybe not the traditional Chinese seasoning, but you know, the ingredients are from here, of course.
[00:04:22,000 -> 00:04:25,839] Yeah, it is Chinese food technically, you know.
[00:04:25,839 -> 00:04:28,879] Chinese food, maybe not Chinese cooking.
[00:04:28,879 -> 00:04:30,399] Yeah, cuisine.
[00:04:30,399 -> 00:04:32,480] Cuisine, yeah.
[00:04:32,480 -> 00:04:35,519] I mean, even that's in the evolution.
[00:04:35,519 -> 00:04:38,240] Before, I think we were a little bit more closer
[00:04:38,240 -> 00:04:40,720] to the palate of Cantonese.
[00:04:40,720 -> 00:04:44,040] But because Shenzhen has so many different people
[00:04:44,040 -> 00:04:45,000] from all over China,
[00:04:45,000 -> 00:04:49,000] it was such a... I would get a complaint that it's not spicy enough,
[00:04:49,000 -> 00:04:52,000] or we didn't use enough bread, or we didn't do this, or you know.
[00:04:52,000 -> 00:04:59,000] And so I had to kind of open the experience to more than just, you know, Cantonese.
[00:04:59,000 -> 00:05:01,000] So I'm from Yantai.
[00:05:01,000 -> 00:05:02,000] Okay.
[00:05:02,000 -> 00:05:05,639] Same place as the Wagyu beef is from. The Wagyu dish is also from Yantai, the same place as the Wagyu beef is from.
[00:05:05,639 -> 00:05:08,839] The Wagyu dish is also from Yantai.
[00:05:08,839 -> 00:05:11,420] Our style is Lu Cai.
[00:05:11,420 -> 00:05:18,160] And there are actually two styles of Lu Cai, which means Shannonese food.
[00:05:18,160 -> 00:05:25,199] One is the western, more inland, a lot of sauce and soy sauce.
[00:05:25,199 -> 00:05:25,759] Yeah.
[00:05:25,759 -> 00:05:28,160] In the western part, in the eastern part,
[00:05:28,160 -> 00:05:29,519] it's a lot of seafood.
[00:05:29,519 -> 00:05:34,879] The fish I had yesterday reminds me of that kind of stuff, cooking.
[00:05:34,879 -> 00:05:35,379] Okay.
[00:05:35,759 -> 00:05:41,680] Yeah, stock, seafood, and lighter seasoning.
[00:05:41,680 -> 00:05:42,399] Right, right.
[00:05:42,399 -> 00:05:45,240] And never overcook.
[00:05:45,240 -> 00:05:47,079] So we also cook our shrimp,
[00:05:47,079 -> 00:05:50,879] and the shrimp, the temperature has to be perfect
[00:05:50,879 -> 00:05:52,720] and not overcooked.
[00:05:52,720 -> 00:05:57,720] So I feel in the core of fandangy
[00:05:57,759 -> 00:06:01,079] and the core of the traditional Chinese cooking,
[00:06:01,079 -> 00:06:02,959] I'm much aligned.
[00:06:02,959 -> 00:06:03,879] I agree with you.
[00:06:03,879 -> 00:06:08,759] But you didn't go to find wisdom or inspiration
[00:06:08,759 -> 00:06:11,480] from the Chinese style of cooking, no?
[00:06:11,480 -> 00:06:12,439] Sometimes.
[00:06:12,439 -> 00:06:15,879] How curious are you in the Chinese cooking,
[00:06:15,879 -> 00:06:17,639] all the Chinese cooking styles?
[00:06:17,639 -> 00:06:20,680] I mean, I would love to actually spend time
[00:06:20,680 -> 00:06:23,399] in a Chinese kitchen.
[00:06:23,399 -> 00:06:27,000] But it's just kind of hard right now.
[00:06:27,000 -> 00:06:33,800] Then priority wise, learning ingredients and learning cooking styles?
[00:06:33,800 -> 00:06:39,920] I mean they're the same. Because usually when I find an ingredient, I research how it's
[00:06:39,920 -> 00:06:46,079] cooked locally first. And then I maybe take some ideas or maybe do something completely
[00:06:46,079 -> 00:06:53,079] different. But I'll always try to do it how the local might prepare the ingredient first.
[00:06:53,079 -> 00:06:58,879] Is it hard to learn or is it very different, the cooking techniques?
[00:06:58,879 -> 00:07:04,079] I mean to learn, to make it good is easy, to make it great is difficult. So I think
[00:07:04,079 -> 00:07:08,199] to be a master you need many years of experience and lots of understanding.
[00:07:08,199 -> 00:07:14,519] But I think if you just spend time in a kitchen, you already have a certain understanding of
[00:07:14,519 -> 00:07:23,560] how food, proteins, liquids, fats all react to different heat, temperatures, fermentation,
[00:07:23,560 -> 00:07:26,800] acids, all of these things kind of interact.
[00:07:26,800 -> 00:07:31,720] So if you know the foundations of cooking, you can kind of jump in any cooking style
[00:07:31,720 -> 00:07:35,680] and I think somewhat achieve good results.
[00:07:35,680 -> 00:07:41,839] But in Chinese cuisine, and I think the Chinese, you know, you make, you pick certain details
[00:07:41,839 -> 00:07:45,319] that are very, you know, like the Cantonese, the way they steam
[00:07:45,319 -> 00:07:47,360] a fish.
[00:07:47,360 -> 00:07:51,800] Even if I steamed it perfectly, it still wouldn't be good enough, you know, because they wouldn't
[00:07:51,800 -> 00:07:52,800] master it to perfection.
[00:07:52,800 -> 00:07:58,600] Yeah, you know, you need to have some sort of street credit, you know, you need to be...
[00:07:58,600 -> 00:08:01,399] Street credit, but also the way it's presented.
[00:08:01,399 -> 00:08:11,199] Like the Cantonese require it to be right in front of you, you have ten seconds, and after the ten seconds it's going back. By the way, it's done here.
[00:08:11,199 -> 00:08:12,199] You cannot do that.
[00:08:12,199 -> 00:08:18,120] Yeah, exactly. So I can't approach it the same way. I have to do it differently. And
[00:08:18,120 -> 00:08:23,959] we tried to do some ingredients closer to traditional methods, and that was always the
[00:08:23,959 -> 00:08:27,000] biggest rejection in the
[00:08:27,000 -> 00:08:33,240] dining room. That's true. And so it's like okay you know let's all cook the way I
[00:08:33,240 -> 00:08:38,120] know how to cook best maybe with a little bit of influence or I can improve
[00:08:38,120 -> 00:08:53,320] my skills by understanding another type of skill you I think some hints of the traditional way of cooking can be pleasant in the experience,
[00:08:53,320 -> 00:08:59,320] but too much of it, then you draw yourself into this comparison that you don't want to.
[00:08:59,320 -> 00:09:00,320] Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:00,320 -> 00:09:03,960] And then you become fusion, bad fusion.
[00:09:03,960 -> 00:09:09,919] One big difference I noticed between Chinese cooking and Western cooking is in the sauce.
[00:09:09,919 -> 00:09:17,559] Most Chinese sauce is fermented, and most Western sauce is never fermented.
[00:09:17,559 -> 00:09:23,919] But we've been doing, or I've been doing fermented sauce very early, even in any country I worked
[00:09:23,919 -> 00:09:31,320] in. I think it's a big inspiration from Asian countries.
[00:09:31,320 -> 00:09:35,840] Western sauces now, I think, have a lot of fermentation involved in them.
[00:09:35,840 -> 00:09:49,639] Classically, Western sauces don't season, instead of salt, we use, you know, garum or soy sauces,
[00:09:49,639 -> 00:09:54,639] Jiangyus, however you want to call it, made from the ingredient.
[00:09:54,639 -> 00:10:00,639] So, instead of, you know, fermenting soybeans and rice, we ferment beef and rice.
[00:10:00,639 -> 00:10:04,639] You know, and that's, and then we season our beef shu with that.
[00:10:04,639 -> 00:10:07,919] And then instead of adding acid, vinegar,
[00:10:07,919 -> 00:10:14,919] which is also a type of fermentation, we might use another type of lacto-fermentation. So
[00:10:14,919 -> 00:10:21,879] we're just taking the same kind of core way of approaching a Western sauce, but we're
[00:10:21,879 -> 00:10:26,159] adding more flavor and more levels of flavor by using fermentation
[00:10:26,159 -> 00:10:29,200] subtly.
[00:10:29,200 -> 00:10:31,720] How do you like the, last question then.
[00:10:31,720 -> 00:10:32,720] Okay.
[00:10:32,720 -> 00:10:33,720] Yeah.
[00:10:33,720 -> 00:10:36,120] So how do you like the work experience here?
[00:10:36,120 -> 00:10:39,919] Like I know since you've been here, it's mostly COVID, right?
[00:10:39,919 -> 00:10:40,919] The pandemic.
[00:10:40,919 -> 00:10:41,919] Yeah, I guess.
[00:10:41,919 -> 00:10:43,919] I didn't even realize.
[00:10:43,919 -> 00:10:49,000] Yeah, I mean, it's good. I miss home a little bit.
[00:10:49,000 -> 00:10:55,000] But in terms of the work environments, it's well balanced.
[00:10:55,000 -> 00:10:59,000] We don't do lunch here, which is, you know, I can come in to work.
[00:10:59,000 -> 00:11:05,000] I only work 12 hours, which is pretty good for a restaurant.
[00:11:05,000 -> 00:11:07,000] You mentioned 16 hours.
[00:11:07,000 -> 00:11:11,000] Yeah, when I first started some of the jobs, I worked 16 hours.
[00:11:11,000 -> 00:11:16,000] It depends. Like when I worked on the farm, your work and your life is very much mixed, right?
[00:11:16,000 -> 00:11:19,000] Because you wake up early to feed the animals.
[00:11:19,000 -> 00:11:23,000] But you know, you might spend a couple hours outside in the garden,
[00:11:23,000 -> 00:11:26,000] and then go into the kitchen to prepare the ingredients
[00:11:26,000 -> 00:11:27,100] and you eat with the whole family.
[00:11:27,100 -> 00:11:31,299] So your whole life is kind of about this whole cycle.
[00:11:31,299 -> 00:11:36,500] Here it's, you know, I don't have that privilege, but it's, you know,
[00:11:36,500 -> 00:11:40,799] I try to keep a positive work environment, you know, a lot of chefs are,
[00:11:40,799 -> 00:11:47,480] I get angry sometimes, but most of the time, you know, it's about, you know, we play music in the
[00:11:47,480 -> 00:11:56,600] kitchen, we try to have fun and laugh and cook good food for each other.
[00:11:56,600 -> 00:12:02,519] The customers, you start to figure out the customers?
[00:12:02,519 -> 00:12:06,000] Yeah, and then I started to figure out the clients.
[00:12:06,000 -> 00:12:10,000] And you know, also our return guests, like Edward's saying,
[00:12:10,000 -> 00:12:13,000] we have quite a lot of information on them,
[00:12:13,000 -> 00:12:17,000] so we can give them dishes that we know what they'll like.
[00:12:17,000 -> 00:12:20,000] Obviously, I'd like to do more than we are,
[00:12:20,000 -> 00:12:24,000] but it's always balancing what we can handle with the team.
[00:12:24,000 -> 00:12:30,879] And then, yeah, the training the staff is also exciting too, and teaching them different
[00:12:30,879 -> 00:12:31,879] ways.
[00:12:31,879 -> 00:12:35,559] And now, after three years, we've had quite a few people come through the kitchen and
[00:12:35,559 -> 00:12:39,600] move on and continue their success.
[00:12:39,600 -> 00:12:45,279] So that's the most rewarding to be honest actually.
[00:12:45,279 -> 00:12:50,620] Is seeing the stories of these young generation of Chinese cooks.
[00:12:50,620 -> 00:12:51,620] Planting seeds.
[00:12:51,620 -> 00:12:52,620] Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:52,620 -> 00:12:54,100] That's a good metaphor.
[00:12:54,100 -> 00:12:56,659] Planting seeds for the future growth.
[00:12:56,659 -> 00:13:03,179] And I'm curious to see because I think China has such a strong history, you know, more
[00:13:03,179 -> 00:13:05,200] than almost any other country.
[00:13:13,679 -> 00:13:18,080] And through that history, there's a lot of rules and traditions about cuisine and regions. And a lot of people, like you said, you know, this is how we do it in our region,
[00:13:18,080 -> 00:13:24,240] and this is what we care about. And it's good to have that. And it's good to have that history.
[00:13:24,240 -> 00:13:29,799] But it sometimes scares people from breaking away from those traditions, from being innovative.
[00:13:29,799 -> 00:13:36,399] And I see chefs in China, if they choose to work at a restaurant like An Su,
[00:13:36,399 -> 00:13:40,700] they're already making that choice to break away tradition and to see what else.
[00:13:40,700 -> 00:13:46,840] And I've got two chefs that have worked two years for me and now are running
[00:13:46,840 -> 00:13:54,159] their own kitchens. And I'm curious to see if I taught them. Because it's like how they
[00:13:54,159 -> 00:14:01,799] approach innovation and creating a new dish is very foreign for them. And that creativity,
[00:14:01,799 -> 00:14:05,000] and once you spark that, it's exciting to see.
[00:14:05,000 -> 00:14:10,000] And since they have more knowledge about this tradition, I always feel like you need to respect it.
[00:14:10,000 -> 00:14:13,000] There are going to be better chefs than me because of that.
[00:14:13,000 -> 00:14:15,000] Different chefs.
[00:14:15,000 -> 00:14:24,000] Be aware of the tradition, know the context, but don't limit to have the freedom to break them or innovate.
[00:14:24,000 -> 00:14:25,440] Right.
[00:14:25,940 -> 00:14:27,120] Me too.
[00:14:32,720 -> 00:14:36,960] Last night after the dinner, I thanked Edward for bringing into two changes, this whole experience and the possibilities.
[00:14:36,960 -> 00:14:37,840] It's very exciting.
[00:14:39,360 -> 00:14:39,919] Thank you.
[00:14:39,919 -> 00:14:40,559] Thank you.
[00:14:40,559 -> 00:14:42,000] Thank you for the interview.
[00:14:42,000 -> 00:14:42,960] Thanks, guys.
[00:14:42,960 -> 00:14:43,360] Thank you.
[00:14:45,440 -> 00:14:46,399] Mysterious AD.
[00:14:47,120 -> 00:14:47,600] All right.
[00:14:47,600 -> 00:14:48,080] Bye.
[00:14:48,080 -> 00:14:48,799] Bye.
