[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,600] 我刚想问的问题为什么又花了这么久
[00:00:03,160 -> 00:00:06,639] 我想问的问题是你对自己感性那部分的自信
[00:00:06,639 -> 00:00:10,080] 就是大家对自己喜欢吃什么这件事情
[00:00:10,080 -> 00:00:12,599] 其实是很多时候不了解和不自信的
[00:00:13,119 -> 00:00:14,119] 按道理是最简单的
[00:00:14,119 -> 00:00:16,719] 小时候你肯定喜欢吃什么不喜欢吃什么
[00:00:16,719 -> 00:00:18,079] 这应该是你的第一感受
[00:00:18,480 -> 00:00:21,519] 但是当我们在长大的时候我们学到了更多东西
[00:00:21,519 -> 00:00:23,679] 我就会说这个东西这么贵
[00:00:23,679 -> 00:00:25,960] 但是我不喜欢它那应该是我的问题
[00:00:27,199 -> 00:00:29,879] 慢慢会有一个这样的在成长的过程中
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,600] 但是确实有的时候你这样的想法是对的
[00:00:02,600 -> 00:00:05,040] 这样的想法让你去现实到了更多东西
[00:00:05,040 -> 00:00:06,559] 不一定是贵
[00:00:06,559 -> 00:00:07,839] 但是它可能让你
[00:00:07,839 -> 00:00:10,160] 就是如果有的人说我只喜欢吃这一样东西
[00:00:10,160 -> 00:00:14,160] 那他就没有办法再去尝试接受更多东西了
[00:00:14,519 -> 00:00:16,199] 但是当你接受很多东西的时候
[00:00:16,199 -> 00:00:20,199] 你就对自己的这个taste和preference就不确定
[00:00:21,199 -> 00:00:21,800] 部分吧
[00:00:22,280 -> 00:00:25,920] 因为很多人喜欢这么去考虑这个问题
[00:00:25,920 -> 00:00:26,800] 也没有什么不对了
[00:00:26,800 -> 00:00:29,039] 但是我角度稍微不一样
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,600] 很多人会觉得价钱会影响
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:05,599] 你对一个东西好吃不好吃的认知
[00:00:06,960 -> 00:00:07,599] 的确是
[00:00:07,599 -> 00:00:09,400] 但是不是因为价格高或低
[00:00:09,400 -> 00:00:11,400] 会让你更有偏看的不不不
[00:00:11,960 -> 00:00:14,160] 但凡你是在出去花钱
[00:00:14,199 -> 00:00:15,720] 一个吃的的价位
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:17,600] 是他好吃不好吃的一部分
[00:00:18,199 -> 00:00:19,920] 嗯我个人这么认为
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:24,000] 所以价格让一个人不舒服
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:26,059] 就是必然而然的嘛
[00:00:26,059 -> 00:00:27,899] 然后呢你说就是要会不会太贵了
[00:00:27,899 -> 00:00:29,460] 然后呢我觉得我不喜欢
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,280] 是不是我不对 是不是我不懂
[00:00:01,280 -> 00:00:02,600] 好像是不是我不够见识
[00:00:03,319 -> 00:00:05,160] 有一部分人会怎么想
[00:00:05,160 -> 00:00:05,759] 当然
[00:00:05,759 -> 00:00:07,839] 就比如说我小时候我是不喜欢吃螃蟹的
[00:00:07,839 -> 00:00:09,439] 长大我就超级喜欢吃螃蟹
[00:00:09,960 -> 00:00:10,960] 然后我小时候
[00:00:10,960 -> 00:00:13,599] 就是可能我当第一次接触白松露的味道的时候
[00:00:13,599 -> 00:00:14,880] 我觉得这玩意到底是啥
[00:00:14,880 -> 00:00:17,280] 但是吃多了以后就觉得好像那个东西确实
[00:00:17,280 -> 00:00:18,519] 就觉得它很好吃
[00:00:19,199 -> 00:00:21,120] 但是这个其实说难听了
[00:00:21,120 -> 00:00:25,000] 就是首先你要从小时候到成年了去谈事的话
[00:00:25,440 -> 00:00:27,320] 这个其实有一部分是硬件
[00:00:27,320 -> 00:00:28,359] 有一部分是软件
[00:00:28,359 -> 00:00:29,640] 因为随着我们年龄生长
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,280] 我们的舌头会没有那么敏感了
[00:00:01,280 -> 00:00:01,679] 对不对
[00:00:01,679 -> 00:00:04,599] 我们舌头上的味道会开始死掉
[00:00:04,599 -> 00:00:04,919] 对
[00:00:04,919 -> 00:00:05,799] 你看这是一
[00:00:05,799 -> 00:00:06,839] 而二呢
[00:00:07,360 -> 00:00:08,000] 咋说
[00:00:08,560 -> 00:00:11,679] 我其实已经对一个人吃东西
[00:00:11,679 -> 00:00:13,039] 觉得好吃不好吃
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:14,000] 已经不感兴趣了
[00:00:14,640 -> 00:00:15,759] 我不太感兴趣
[00:00:16,559 -> 00:00:17,399] 我真的不在乎
[00:00:17,399 -> 00:00:18,920] 有人觉得东西好吃还是不好吃
[00:00:18,920 -> 00:00:20,320] 作为一个厨师可以说这种话吗
[00:00:20,320 -> 00:00:21,839] 因为这对我没有影响
[00:00:22,399 -> 00:00:24,679] 你觉得好吃和我半毛关系都没有
[00:00:24,879 -> 00:00:26,239] 唯一一个我获取的信息
[00:00:26,239 -> 00:00:28,120] 就是我和你类似不类似
[00:00:28,120 -> 00:00:28,879] 这就是
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,600] 我做一个东西在这种格式的餐厅
[00:00:02,600 -> 00:00:03,600] 我放出去了
[00:00:03,600 -> 00:00:04,799] 因为我觉得好吃
[00:00:04,799 -> 00:00:05,799] 你也觉得好吃的话
[00:00:05,799 -> 00:00:07,900] 我唯一获取的可采纳信息就是
[00:00:07,900 -> 00:00:09,599] 我和你有多大类似度
[00:00:09,599 -> 00:00:10,199] 相同
[00:00:10,199 -> 00:00:11,599] 懂我什么意思不
[00:00:11,599 -> 00:00:13,400] 我说说类比一下
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:15,199] 就是我因为你说的是你的东西
[00:00:15,199 -> 00:00:17,300] 我想让你确认一下
[00:00:17,300 -> 00:00:18,399] 我理解的是这个意思
[00:00:18,399 -> 00:00:19,699] 我感谢你
[00:00:19,699 -> 00:00:21,399] 这是一个非常有责任性的方式
[00:00:21,399 -> 00:00:22,399] 谢谢
[00:00:22,399 -> 00:00:23,399] 谢谢
[00:00:23,399 -> 00:00:24,800] 我自己的视频
[00:00:24,800 -> 00:00:25,699] 我大概有这种感觉
[00:00:25,699 -> 00:00:27,300] 就是我其实并不在乎流量
[00:00:27,300 -> 00:00:28,699] 我知道有的视频的价值很高
[00:00:28,699 -> 00:00:29,500] 但是它流量很低
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:00,960] 然后有的不是
[00:00:00,960 -> 00:00:02,120] 然后我在工作中的时候
[00:00:02,120 -> 00:00:04,200] 有时候我有的时候我的insight
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:05,320] 我觉得它非常重要
[00:00:05,360 -> 00:00:08,480] 然后但是绝大多数的人会看不到
[00:00:08,480 -> 00:00:09,160] 那个insight
[00:00:09,160 -> 00:00:10,640] 也意识不到它的价值
[00:00:10,679 -> 00:00:12,720] 有的人意识到了会特别开心
[00:00:12,759 -> 00:00:15,800] 但是我并不期待大家去意识到这件事情
[00:00:16,239 -> 00:00:19,600] 可是我之所以能不太在乎大家
[00:00:19,600 -> 00:00:21,399] 是不是在意那件事情
[00:00:21,440 -> 00:00:23,679] 是因为我自己做数据或者做产品
[00:00:23,719 -> 00:00:25,359] 我从头到尾把这件事情
[00:00:25,359 -> 00:00:26,559] 我觉得我想清楚了
[00:00:26,600 -> 00:00:29,120] 我也能知道大家为什么没有想清楚
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,399] 或者大家他们错在哪
[00:00:01,399 -> 00:00:03,799] 我觉得我大概率是能说这件事的
[00:00:03,799 -> 00:00:05,759] 在我一些有限的领域之内
[00:00:05,759 -> 00:00:06,360] 明白
[00:00:06,360 -> 00:00:08,160] 所以我对我自己的观点
[00:00:08,160 -> 00:00:10,199] 和我自己的一些观点是有信心的
[00:00:10,199 -> 00:00:11,279] 我觉得你们看不懂
[00:00:11,279 -> 00:00:12,199] 那是你们的问题
[00:00:12,199 -> 00:00:12,800] 明白
[00:00:12,800 -> 00:00:15,439] 可是在这个吃这件事情上
[00:00:15,439 -> 00:00:17,199] 它一方面就像你刚说的
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:18,480] 很感性很主观对吧
[00:00:18,480 -> 00:00:20,320] 它应该是可能是人最主观的事情
[00:00:20,320 -> 00:00:21,960] 但是同时又似乎不是
[00:00:21,960 -> 00:00:23,160] 就是它
[00:00:23,160 -> 00:00:24,359] 我们把这个放这边
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 假设我
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,000] 就你不好奇吧
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:06,000] 你不好奇为什么你觉得好吃的东西
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:08,000] 别人觉得不好吃
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:10,000] 因为就算他回答了我
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:12,000] 这不是我可采纳的意见
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,000] I can't do anything with this information
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:16,000] 比如说
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:18,000] 这根薯条
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:20,000] 你吃一半我吃一半
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 我觉得它恶心你觉得它好吃
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:24,000] And I ask you why
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:26,000] And you go because I really like it
[00:00:26,000 -> 00:00:28,000] And I ask you why
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,280] 我问你为什么
[00:00:01,280 -> 00:00:03,399] 你说因为我喜欢咸土豆
[00:00:03,399 -> 00:00:05,639] 我没有办法用这些资料
[00:00:05,639 -> 00:00:07,000] 我用不上
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:09,880] 因为始终比如说我是个不喜欢咸土豆的人
[00:00:09,880 -> 00:00:10,679] 你是
[00:00:10,679 -> 00:00:11,839] 我怎么用
[00:00:11,839 -> 00:00:17,120] 这就是你知道他为什么会有和你不同的观点
[00:00:17,120 -> 00:00:20,600] 你已经知道了他为什么会有和你的不同观点
[00:00:20,600 -> 00:00:23,000] 然后你已经把它纳入你的喜好
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:24,960] 但是你们两个喜好不一样
[00:00:24,960 -> 00:00:26,480] 但是很多时候观点不一致
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:28,280] 不是因为喜好不一样
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,679] 就比如说你说这个薯条
[00:00:01,679 -> 00:00:02,720] 如果你吃了这个薯条
[00:00:02,720 -> 00:00:04,200] 你告诉我非常恶心
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:06,200] 我觉得应该不是因为你的偏好
[00:00:06,200 -> 00:00:08,640] 因为有什么东西我没有看到
[00:00:09,640 -> 00:00:10,560] 那你为什么会这么想呢
[00:00:10,560 -> 00:00:11,599] 因为我穿着口罩
[00:00:11,599 -> 00:00:12,560] 就因为我穿着围裙
[00:00:12,560 -> 00:00:13,199] 你会更注重我的
[00:00:13,199 -> 00:00:14,800] 不 就是另外随便一个人告诉我说
[00:00:14,800 -> 00:00:16,879] 他觉得这个薯条吃了好恶心
[00:00:16,879 -> 00:00:20,640] 因为这是一个很意外的说法
[00:00:20,640 -> 00:00:22,320] 因为这是一个和我的认知
[00:00:22,320 -> 00:00:23,320] 我的认知平时在这儿
[00:00:23,320 -> 00:00:25,239] 我觉得任何人的认知
[00:00:25,239 -> 00:00:26,519] 差不多都会在这一圈
[00:00:26,519 -> 00:00:27,320] 结果他突然在这里
[00:00:27,320 -> 00:00:29,000] 对啊 意外不就是在概率上嘛
[00:00:29,000 -> 00:00:29,519] 对不对
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,000] 意外就是可能性
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,879] 那可能他信号的就是
[00:00:04,879 -> 00:00:06,639] 有可能是一个小概率事件
[00:00:06,639 -> 00:00:08,320] 有可能是我有一块东西
[00:00:08,320 -> 00:00:09,759] 我根本就完全不知道
[00:00:09,759 -> 00:00:10,439] 可能
[00:00:10,439 -> 00:00:11,839] 但是说回我的核心是
[00:00:11,839 -> 00:00:13,039] 就算你摸清楚了
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:14,480] 它具体是个什么理科
[00:00:14,480 -> 00:00:15,960] 你能用这些资料做什么
[00:00:16,399 -> 00:00:18,760] 你能改变面包的制作方式吗
[00:00:18,760 -> 00:00:19,359] 不
[00:00:21,399 -> 00:00:23,199] 你只能做面包的服务
[00:00:23,199 -> 00:00:24,280] 或者不做面包的服务
[00:00:24,280 -> 00:00:25,640] 这是你做厨师的唯一选择
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:27,800] 所以就像我说回到
[00:00:27,800 -> 00:00:29,960] 你这一辈子就一定额度的耐心
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,599] 我对食客的偏好越来越感兴趣的话
[00:00:05,599 -> 00:00:06,599] 我会越来越累
[00:00:06,599 -> 00:00:07,120] 对
[00:00:07,120 -> 00:00:09,400] And I can't serve food for very long
[00:00:09,400 -> 00:00:11,080] If I keep thinking like that
[00:00:11,080 -> 00:00:12,679] I'll go fucking insane
[00:00:12,679 -> 00:00:13,279] 对
[00:00:13,279 -> 00:00:13,880] 然后对我来说
[00:00:13,880 -> 00:00:15,400] 重口难调就是最简单的道理
[00:00:15,400 -> 00:00:17,399] 对我来说我不觉得
[00:00:18,399 -> 00:00:19,960] 重要的原因很简单
[00:00:20,280 -> 00:00:23,679] 是因为跟我说这个东西不好吃的人
[00:00:23,679 -> 00:00:25,440] 也没有想再攻击我
[00:00:25,440 -> 00:00:25,960] 对
[00:00:25,960 -> 00:00:26,519] 对不对
[00:00:26,519 -> 00:00:29,079] 甚至要是我们没有走形式主义
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,280] 你问他今天晚上吃的怎么样的话
[00:00:01,280 -> 00:00:03,279] 他根本不会吭声也不会说
[00:00:03,279 -> 00:00:05,480] 你现在已经觉得这个是个形式主义了
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:06,480] 对
[00:00:06,480 -> 00:00:07,799] 你吃的怎么样
[00:00:07,799 -> 00:00:09,080] 我不在乎
[00:00:09,919 -> 00:00:10,439] 对不对
[00:00:10,439 -> 00:00:12,439] 我刚去美国的时候就觉得这个东西很奇怪
[00:00:12,439 -> 00:00:13,279] 对啊 我不在乎
[00:00:13,279 -> 00:00:15,679] 就是我不是很在乎
[00:00:15,679 -> 00:00:18,399] 就是我听到别人帮我端盘子的人说
[00:00:18,399 -> 00:00:19,120] 你今天晚上吃的怎么样
[00:00:19,120 -> 00:00:19,839] 你不在乎
[00:00:20,320 -> 00:00:20,920] 你不在乎
[00:00:20,920 -> 00:00:22,079] 你会拿这些进去干嘛
[00:00:22,519 -> 00:00:24,239] 你会改变你的餐厅吗
[00:00:24,239 -> 00:00:25,079] 因为我恨这里
[00:00:25,079 -> 00:00:25,679] 不
[00:00:25,679 -> 00:00:26,719] 所以你为什么要改
[00:00:27,039 -> 00:00:29,079] 我觉得我对美国人两个事情
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,000] 我觉得特别
[00:00:01,000 -> 00:00:03,399] 大家觉得特别有礼貌的虚伪
[00:00:03,399 -> 00:00:05,240] 一个就是你吃的怎么样
[00:00:05,240 -> 00:00:06,480] 另外一个就是
[00:00:06,480 -> 00:00:07,599] I'm psyched to be here
[00:00:07,599 -> 00:00:08,679] 然后就是我
[00:00:08,679 -> 00:00:09,400] 因为他们吃小饭
[00:00:09,400 -> 00:00:10,800] 开场的时候就会说
[00:00:10,800 -> 00:00:12,439] 在任何会议开场的时候就会说
[00:00:12,439 -> 00:00:13,400] 我好开心
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:14,279] 是因为对我来说
[00:00:14,279 -> 00:00:16,800] 我现在对待我的餐厅更是一个社交漏网
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:18,199] 懂我什么意思不
[00:00:18,199 -> 00:00:19,000] 就是一个什么
[00:00:19,000 -> 00:00:19,399] 很简单
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:20,399] 我是这么个思维
[00:00:20,399 -> 00:00:21,879] 你四个字是什么
[00:00:21,879 -> 00:00:22,480] 社交漏网
[00:00:22,480 -> 00:00:23,800] 对啊 社会漏网
[00:00:24,199 -> 00:00:25,000] 社会漏网
[00:00:25,000 -> 00:00:29,000] 有很多社会的漏网
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,240] 你所看的地方都是社会的库拉德
[00:00:02,240 -> 00:00:03,080] 对吧
[00:00:03,839 -> 00:00:04,799] 我怎么去解释呢
[00:00:04,799 -> 00:00:06,879] 就是以往我是希望做一个
[00:00:06,879 -> 00:00:08,240] 每个东西都是每个人的餐厅
[00:00:08,240 -> 00:00:10,439] 就是尽可能完美主义者的
[00:00:10,439 -> 00:00:11,480] 就是完美情况之下
[00:00:11,480 -> 00:00:12,720] 就是所有人都喜欢我的餐厅
[00:00:12,720 -> 00:00:14,039] 就是你几年前的想法
[00:00:14,039 -> 00:00:15,800] 不是 任何厨师开始
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:17,800] 每个厨师都想要成为完美的厨师
[00:00:17,800 -> 00:00:20,160] 每个厨师都想要有20-30米琛兰星
[00:00:20,160 -> 00:00:21,359] 否则为什么要做
[00:00:21,359 -> 00:00:22,480] 就像很多人学音乐制作
[00:00:22,480 -> 00:00:23,640] 是因为他们想出名
[00:00:23,640 -> 00:00:25,760] 不是因为他们想做一个工程师
[00:00:25,760 -> 00:00:26,879] 一个音频工程师
[00:00:26,879 -> 00:00:27,679] 一个声音工程师
[00:00:27,679 -> 00:00:29,559] 废话了 没有人开始这种梦想
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:00,960] 所以在这个前提之下
[00:00:02,240 -> 00:00:02,879] 我这么说吧
[00:00:04,160 -> 00:00:06,719] 现在我的理念很简单
[00:00:06,719 -> 00:00:09,000] 你在项目起家搭建的那一瞬间
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:10,439] 在筹备的过程当中
[00:00:10,679 -> 00:00:14,000] 你得对你自己的信仰有一定的信心
[00:00:14,519 -> 00:00:17,199] 信仰指的是你最近你的故事题材
[00:00:17,320 -> 00:00:17,600] 对不对
[00:00:17,600 -> 00:00:19,719] 你餐厅存在的前提
[00:00:19,760 -> 00:00:20,039] 对不对
[00:00:20,039 -> 00:00:20,719] 这是你的信仰
[00:00:20,760 -> 00:00:21,559] 是你信仰的代表
[00:00:21,679 -> 00:00:21,960] 对不对
[00:00:21,960 -> 00:00:23,160] 你硬件化了你的信仰
[00:00:23,160 -> 00:00:23,600] 好
[00:00:23,960 -> 00:00:24,839] 在这个前提之下
[00:00:24,839 -> 00:00:26,079] 你就看你的硬功夫了
[00:00:26,079 -> 00:00:27,320] 你按不按游戏规则出牌
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,080] 你是不是一个睿智理智的生意经营者
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:05,320] 剩下的很简单
[00:00:05,320 -> 00:00:07,000] 你赌的对不对
[00:00:08,080 -> 00:00:09,039] 我赌对了没有
[00:00:09,039 -> 00:00:11,759] 我赌在深圳大街上
[00:00:12,199 -> 00:00:13,640] 100个王八犊子里边
[00:00:13,640 -> 00:00:15,279] 有一个王八犊子是像我这样的
[00:00:15,279 -> 00:00:16,480] 我这餐厅能活得下来
[00:00:17,359 -> 00:00:18,359] 这是我赌的概率
[00:00:18,359 -> 00:00:20,600] And that's the only reason I'm still alive today
[00:00:20,920 -> 00:00:21,839] 因为我这好吃吗
[00:00:21,839 -> 00:00:22,440] 并不是
[00:00:22,440 -> 00:00:24,039] 你说你没有吃过更好吃的汉堡吗
[00:00:24,039 -> 00:00:24,600] Of course
[00:00:24,879 -> 00:00:26,039] 你说晚餐好吃吗
[00:00:26,039 -> 00:00:27,559] 我觉得我在深圳吃的汉堡
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,879] 我可以说这是我在深圳吃的最好吃的
[00:00:02,879 -> 00:00:04,320] 但我在深圳也没有吃到这么好吃
[00:00:04,320 -> 00:00:05,200] 有很多更好的漢堡
[00:00:05,200 -> 00:00:06,400] 待会你走的时候我给你放在那边
[00:00:06,400 -> 00:00:07,519] 有很多更好的漢堡
[00:00:07,519 -> 00:00:08,480] 比我们在这吃的更好
[00:00:08,480 -> 00:00:09,919] 你说我们餐厅好吃吗
[00:00:09,919 -> 00:00:10,720] 真的不见得
[00:00:10,720 -> 00:00:11,359] 难吃吗
[00:00:11,359 -> 00:00:12,080] 当然说不上了
[00:00:12,080 -> 00:00:12,720] 但是好吃吗
[00:00:12,720 -> 00:00:13,519] 真的不见得
[00:00:13,519 -> 00:00:14,400] 对不对
[00:00:14,400 -> 00:00:16,399] 来这就是因为有一部分人
[00:00:16,399 -> 00:00:17,600] 常图个心性过来
[00:00:17,600 -> 00:00:19,920] 有一部分人觉得这个地方很奇怪
[00:00:19,920 -> 00:00:22,559] 我享受这个吃不明白的过程
[00:00:22,559 -> 00:00:24,640] 它不好吃我都能原谅
[00:00:24,640 -> 00:00:26,239] 但是我不能原谅无聊
[00:00:26,239 -> 00:00:27,280] 这是我赌的
[00:00:27,280 -> 00:00:29,120] 有很多人想解决无聊来我这
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,240] 所以他们来这里是为了不沉寂
[00:00:02,799 -> 00:00:04,200] 所以我还活着
[00:00:04,839 -> 00:00:09,679] 但你这个就离那个品质远了
[00:00:10,279 -> 00:00:13,039] 我再说一个我说这个品质是什么意思
[00:00:13,199 -> 00:00:15,400] 就是这个品质稍稍长一点
[00:00:15,400 -> 00:00:16,600] 不一定要放到视频里边
[00:00:16,600 -> 00:00:18,600] 就是给你说一下我为什么
[00:00:18,600 -> 00:00:19,399] 不 你可以放在视频里面
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:19,839] 我不介意
[00:00:19,839 -> 00:00:21,839] 不 我觉得没有必要
[00:00:21,839 -> 00:00:23,280] 因为我在视频里曾经讲过
[00:00:24,039 -> 00:00:25,440] 就是我当时是看一个叫
[00:00:25,440 -> 00:00:27,000] 蚕蚁摩托车维修艺术那本书
[00:00:27,000 -> 00:00:28,199] 不知道你有没有看过
[00:00:28,280 -> 00:00:29,440] 不 我不读
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,480] 那个说的挺有意思的
[00:00:01,480 -> 00:00:03,640] 他讲一个人就是带着自己的孩子
[00:00:03,640 -> 00:00:04,320] 然后到处逛
[00:00:04,320 -> 00:00:05,799] 然后他其实是一个
[00:00:06,719 -> 00:00:07,360] 他真人
[00:00:07,360 -> 00:00:09,160] 就是作者写的是他本人的故事
[00:00:09,160 -> 00:00:11,240] 他本人就是因为想这个东西想疯了
[00:00:11,240 -> 00:00:12,679] 然后被电击过
[00:00:12,880 -> 00:00:14,160] 然后再带着孩子
[00:00:14,160 -> 00:00:17,280] 然后找回了过去的自己的那样一个故事
[00:00:17,800 -> 00:00:19,960] 他好像是全世界最畅销的哲学书
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:22,199] 然后他里面讲这个摩托车
[00:00:22,239 -> 00:00:24,079] 然后他讲这个quality
[00:00:24,079 -> 00:00:25,079] 然后中文翻译
[00:00:25,120 -> 00:00:27,960] 那个中文翻译叫良知这件事情
[00:00:28,000 -> 00:00:29,600] 然后就是说quality这个东西
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,200] 他到底是一个主观的还是一个客观的东西
[00:00:02,200 -> 00:00:02,799] 嗯
[00:00:02,799 -> 00:00:03,200] 对
[00:00:04,559 -> 00:00:08,279] 我不在乎别人对品质的看法
[00:00:08,279 -> 00:00:09,880] 但我会告诉你我的看法
[00:00:09,880 -> 00:00:10,400] 嗯
[00:00:11,880 -> 00:00:13,199] 很多人会误会了
[00:00:13,199 -> 00:00:15,880] 厨师追求细致
[00:00:15,880 -> 00:00:16,960] 这不是真的
[00:00:16,960 -> 00:00:17,519] 稳定性嘛
[00:00:17,519 -> 00:00:18,839] 产品稳定性
[00:00:18,839 -> 00:00:20,079] 一天和一天一模一样的
[00:00:20,079 -> 00:00:22,440] 今天也是明天也是后天也是
[00:00:22,440 -> 00:00:24,719] 这不仅是真的
[00:00:24,719 -> 00:00:27,199] 厨师想要经验细致
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,879] I want you to be the same amount of happy every time, if not more
[00:00:03,560 -> 00:00:05,040] But I don't care how I...
[00:00:05,040 -> 00:00:06,879] Yeah, I don't care how you get there
[00:00:07,400 -> 00:00:08,679] I don't care how you get there
[00:00:09,240 -> 00:00:10,359] Like I said, back to sex
[00:00:10,359 -> 00:00:11,560] We're all going to the same place
[00:00:11,560 -> 00:00:12,560] How do you fuck?
[00:00:12,960 -> 00:00:13,240] Right?
[00:00:13,240 -> 00:00:14,359] If you fuck the same every day
[00:00:14,359 -> 00:00:15,759] Then what's the fucking point of fucking?
[00:00:15,759 -> 00:00:16,000] Right?
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:16,800] You get bored
[00:00:17,440 -> 00:00:17,839] Right?
[00:00:17,839 -> 00:00:19,519] That's what a good restaurant is
[00:00:19,519 -> 00:00:21,519] It makes you the same amount of happy every time
[00:00:21,519 -> 00:00:24,160] But how it made you happy is different every time
[00:00:25,559 -> 00:00:26,679] Or else you're boring
[00:00:26,879 -> 00:00:28,120] What's the point of being a chef?
[00:00:28,519 -> 00:00:29,039] 对不对
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,200] 所以那说回我觉得quality是什么
[00:00:02,200 -> 00:00:07,080] quality是能在那么多可变因素的前提之下
[00:00:07,400 -> 00:00:09,000] 找到同样的结果
[00:00:10,320 -> 00:00:13,320] 不考虑手段和你消耗的材料和怎么怎么的
[00:00:13,320 -> 00:00:16,920] 只要最终结果是你来的客人开心了
[00:00:17,600 -> 00:00:18,359] that's quality
[00:00:18,359 -> 00:00:19,440] I don't care how you got there
[00:00:19,679 -> 00:00:21,600] 是三道菜还是五道菜还是十道菜
[00:00:21,600 -> 00:00:22,719] 不重要的对我来说
[00:00:26,280 -> 00:00:28,800] 因为很多人就会觉得我想吃你上个季的东西
[00:00:28,800 -> 00:00:29,760] 我说你不会喜欢的
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,120] 为什么?是因为你上次来的时候是海鲜季节啊
[00:00:03,120 -> 00:00:04,120] 现在不是
[00:00:04,480 -> 00:00:05,480] 我又不是老天爷
[00:00:05,480 -> 00:00:07,679] 我没办法做成像上次那么好吃
[00:00:08,199 -> 00:00:09,359] 你别难为我呀
[00:00:10,679 -> 00:00:13,400] 那行我在这个情形下我可以选择养殖的海鲜
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:14,000] 对不对
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:15,560] 一年四季都一个嘎嘎一样
[00:00:15,560 -> 00:00:16,559] 但是它就是不甜
[00:00:16,559 -> 00:00:17,559] 它就是不好吃
[00:00:17,559 -> 00:00:20,039] 它是70%的好
[00:00:20,879 -> 00:00:22,480] 那我做不到100%的好
[00:00:22,480 -> 00:00:24,199] 因为我用这些材料
[00:00:24,199 -> 00:00:25,519] 我不能改变自然
[00:00:27,239 -> 00:00:28,120] 我懂了
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,760] 就是他不是关于食物的quality
[00:00:01,760 -> 00:00:03,120] 而是关于experience的quality
[00:00:03,120 -> 00:00:04,120] 然后最终呢
[00:00:04,120 -> 00:00:06,839] It's also the quality of my fucking mental health
[00:00:07,519 -> 00:00:09,679] 因为我不想和这些人解释了
[00:00:09,960 -> 00:00:10,800] 我以往想
[00:00:10,800 -> 00:00:13,599] 因为我觉得我能改变他们的思维
[00:00:13,720 -> 00:00:15,519] 我觉得我能影响到他们的思维
[00:00:15,560 -> 00:00:17,199] 但是来花钱的人是
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:19,000] 特别是在深圳是不受教育
[00:00:19,000 -> 00:00:20,280] 他们不想被教育
[00:00:21,320 -> 00:00:21,839] 明白
[00:00:22,160 -> 00:00:24,239] One of the crowning
[00:00:24,920 -> 00:00:26,359] shortcomings of humanity
[00:00:26,359 -> 00:00:28,679] is we hate feeling like we're learning
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,600] 我们喜欢学习
[00:00:01,600 -> 00:00:03,480] 我们不喜欢感觉像在学习
[00:00:03,480 -> 00:00:05,839] 所以从小长大我们喜欢的老师和教授
[00:00:05,839 -> 00:00:07,960] 都是让我们没有感受到我们在学习
[00:00:07,960 -> 00:00:09,279] 但是我们学习到了
[00:00:09,279 -> 00:00:11,560] 这是一个好的老师或教授的标杆
[00:00:11,560 -> 00:00:12,279] 仅此而已
[00:00:12,279 -> 00:00:13,560] 我们作为人类
[00:00:13,560 -> 00:00:15,000] 我们不喜欢感受到我们在学习
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:16,079] 但是我们只喜欢学习
[00:00:16,079 -> 00:00:18,719] 你这个观点是怎么得出的呢
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:21,640] 因为我这一辈子没有好好读过书
[00:00:21,640 -> 00:00:23,440] 纯粹是因为我不喜欢听别人巴巴
[00:00:23,440 -> 00:00:25,640] 可是你还讲
[00:00:25,640 -> 00:00:27,920] 我呀 我不是那么爱讲
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,120] 但是我 但是相对来说
[00:00:02,120 -> 00:00:03,000] 相对普通人来说
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,679] 你让我把后半句说完嘛 对不对
[00:00:04,679 -> 00:00:07,599] 那但是你听不懂和我说不明白两个比起来
[00:00:07,599 -> 00:00:09,160] 我情愿我说不明白
[00:00:09,160 -> 00:00:10,880] 那我愿意继续说到你明白为止
[00:00:11,160 -> 00:00:13,119] 因为你没听明白肯定是我没说对
[00:00:13,119 -> 00:00:14,720] 不是因为你的理解能力有误
[00:00:14,720 -> 00:00:17,000] 所以导致我很能说
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:19,440] 我急 我就怕我没说明白
[00:00:19,440 -> 00:00:20,719] 不是因为我喜欢说
[00:00:20,719 -> 00:00:23,519] 要是我有这个本事在一句话之内讲明白的话
[00:00:24,640 -> 00:00:26,359] 那我就一句话
[00:00:26,640 -> 00:00:27,640] 仅限一句话
[00:00:27,839 -> 00:00:29,000] 但是我没那个本事
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 我高寒这辈子都不会有那个本事
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,000] 慢慢会变得更短暂
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:06,000] No 别挡镜头 哥
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:08,000] 怎么了
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:10,000] 可以稍等我一下啊
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:12,000] 来
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,000] 现在 行行行 来来来 合个照
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 来
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:26,000] 那么不乐意的表情
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 你需要咖啡吗?
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:03,000] 不需要
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,000] 好
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:05,000] 对
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:06,000] 我觉得慢慢会变好的
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:09,000] 因为你要表达的那些底层都是已经表达过了
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:11,000] 然后你也就不需要再去表达了
[00:00:11,000 -> 00:00:13,000] 不,人们不想听
[00:00:13,000 -> 00:00:14,000] 人们不喜欢听
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:18,000] 我只会变得越来越不想表达
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:21,000] 因为感情交易的公式很简单
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:23,000] 就是耐心和时间
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:25,000] 我的耐心是有限
[00:00:25,000 -> 00:00:26,000] 我的时间也是有限
[00:00:26,000 -> 00:00:28,000] 我活了一辈子
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,559] 就是我这一辈子要是能在时间结束前
[00:00:04,559 -> 00:00:07,519] 还有耐心可以就余额的话
[00:00:07,519 -> 00:00:08,480] 那是成功了
[00:00:09,519 -> 00:00:11,759] 但是有一定可能性是在我嗝前
[00:00:11,759 -> 00:00:12,679] 我就没有耐心了
[00:00:12,679 -> 00:00:14,279] 耐心可能是可以培养的
[00:00:14,279 -> 00:00:14,800] 如果有这个
[00:00:14,800 -> 00:00:16,160] I don't think so
[00:00:16,800 -> 00:00:19,359] 耐心的培养就是看你愿意放弃什么
[00:00:19,760 -> 00:00:20,480] 这不是培养
[00:00:20,480 -> 00:00:22,440] 这只是你考虑的范围越来越窄了
[00:00:23,160 -> 00:00:24,160] What I used to care about
[00:00:24,160 -> 00:00:25,359] I don't care about anymore
[00:00:25,359 -> 00:00:26,480] which makes me happier
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:27,640] it really really does
[00:00:27,640 -> 00:00:28,879] 对这是一种解脱
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,639] 我猜你也经历过吧
[00:00:01,639 -> 00:00:03,000] 当你还是个年轻的男孩
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,879] 你对很多事情都很在意
[00:00:04,879 -> 00:00:05,400] 对的
[00:00:05,400 -> 00:00:07,120] 这让你很累
[00:00:07,120 -> 00:00:08,480] 你到底是什么意思
[00:00:10,039 -> 00:00:11,679] 就像年轻小伙子约会一样
[00:00:11,679 -> 00:00:14,720] 我会尽全力去试探每个人的性格
[00:00:14,720 -> 00:00:16,280] 但你不需要每个人的性格
[00:00:16,280 -> 00:00:17,640] 你只需要一个让你累的
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:19,879] 好
[00:00:20,280 -> 00:00:23,120] 我觉得我就剩下最后一个问题
[00:00:23,120 -> 00:00:23,679] 对
[00:00:23,679 -> 00:00:26,359] 就是刚刚我们讲了很多你不想做的事情
[00:00:26,359 -> 00:00:27,719] 或者说你不喜欢的东西
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,279] 然后你提到了这个strong belief
[00:00:02,279 -> 00:00:03,799] 或者说是一个绝对的belief
[00:00:03,799 -> 00:00:06,719] 你自己的belief和你想做的事情
[00:00:06,719 -> 00:00:09,320] 你想把你的耐心和时间放到事情上是什么
[00:00:10,679 -> 00:00:18,600] I want to foster, nurture people to cook but not become cooks
[00:00:19,320 -> 00:00:22,199] 我希望我的存在能
[00:00:22,399 -> 00:00:25,039] 我觉得我就被你这个带到了目的
[00:00:25,039 -> 00:00:25,640] Thank you
[00:00:25,879 -> 00:00:27,079] 因为我是
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,719] 这真的就是我之前真的是看了很多这个就是做菜的频道
[00:00:04,719 -> 00:00:05,519] 很精美对吧
[00:00:05,519 -> 00:00:07,599] 然后做的效果也不错
[00:00:07,599 -> 00:00:09,960] 但是我在做菜的过程中没有体会到快乐
[00:00:09,960 -> 00:00:10,599] 因为我不懂
[00:00:10,599 -> 00:00:12,279] 我只是在follow他们的recipe
[00:00:12,279 -> 00:00:14,199] 我妹妹05年
[00:00:14,199 -> 00:00:16,559] 她就是一个特别就是follow recipe
[00:00:16,559 -> 00:00:17,879] to the letter的人
[00:00:17,879 -> 00:00:18,679] 肯克班的人
[00:00:18,679 -> 00:00:19,199] 对
[00:00:19,320 -> 00:00:22,600] 她就拒绝不follow recipe
[00:00:22,719 -> 00:00:24,679] 但是我就很想说为什么要这么做
[00:00:24,679 -> 00:00:27,160] 然后看你的频道以后我感受到了
[00:00:27,160 -> 00:00:28,239] 哦可以是这样子的
[00:00:28,239 -> 00:00:29,399] 我觉得这个东西懂了
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,200] 我印象很深的就是你说在家里疫情的时候
[00:00:03,200 -> 00:00:04,400] 推荐你在家做什么
[00:00:04,400 -> 00:00:07,200] 你说把鸡放进去
[00:00:07,200 -> 00:00:08,599] 然后高压锅压一压
[00:00:08,599 -> 00:00:09,599] 然后肉可以吃
[00:00:09,599 -> 00:00:11,599] 我都跟他说柴做汤
[00:00:11,599 -> 00:00:12,400] 对做好
[00:00:12,400 -> 00:00:13,400] 当时我就觉得对
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:15,000] 就是做菜的感觉
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:17,000] 因为我发现
[00:00:18,199 -> 00:00:19,199] 我推测
[00:00:19,199 -> 00:00:21,399] 现在很多年轻孩子想当厨师
[00:00:21,399 -> 00:00:22,800] 不是因为他们想当厨师
[00:00:22,800 -> 00:00:24,600] 是因为一他们觉得做饭帅
[00:00:24,600 -> 00:00:26,199] 然后二他们看做饭可以出名
[00:00:27,000 -> 00:00:27,800] I wanna be Gordon Ramsay
[00:00:27,800 -> 00:00:28,600] I wanna be Jamie Oliver
[00:00:28,600 -> 00:00:29,399] I wanna be a celebrity chef
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,000] 我想要有米其林星星
[00:00:01,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 我想要大家爱我
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:03,000] 我想要大家尊重我
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:05,599] 我想穿个白白净净的很漂亮的厨师服
[00:00:05,599 -> 00:00:06,599] 一个牛仔围裙
[00:00:06,599 -> 00:00:07,799] 搁那甜甜的阿涅茲
[00:00:07,799 -> 00:00:08,800] 涅花冒烟
[00:00:09,300 -> 00:00:12,000] 你说的是想当厨师的年轻人
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,599] 不是年轻人觉得自己想当厨师
[00:00:15,599 -> 00:00:17,000] 所以我的目的很简单
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 我希望能给到所有人一切他们需要的工具
[00:00:22,500 -> 00:00:25,500] 去准准确确的非常精准
[00:00:25,600 -> 00:00:27,300] 非常坦率的去探索
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,759] 他到底想不想从事这个行业
[00:00:02,759 -> 00:00:04,400] 还是他们只是想做饭而已
[00:00:05,960 -> 00:00:10,119] I'm sick of garbage shit pussy cooks
[00:00:10,919 -> 00:00:13,039] 就是我对一个人的技术有限
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:14,199] 一点意见都没有
[00:00:14,960 -> 00:00:17,399] 我煎一块牛排
[00:00:17,399 -> 00:00:18,960] 你糊到天亮我都无所谓
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:22,320] But I hate pussies that come into a kitchen
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:26,239] 一帮文艺青年天天搁这跟我谈想法和创意
[00:00:26,760 -> 00:00:27,600] It's not important
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,879] 所以我觉得我的一个目的了
[00:00:02,879 -> 00:00:08,400] 我希望能给这些孩子们一个
[00:00:08,400 -> 00:00:09,679] 不能说孩子们吧
[00:00:09,679 -> 00:00:11,720] 就是给现在想从事这个行业的
[00:00:11,720 -> 00:00:13,039] 无论你什么年龄的人了
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:15,919] 想从事这个行业还是想做的
[00:00:15,919 -> 00:00:20,000] 或者是给他们一系列的工具和指导
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:21,679] 鼓励他们去尝试
[00:00:21,679 -> 00:00:23,440] 但做得坦白一点
[00:00:23,440 -> 00:00:25,199] 这有道理吗
[00:00:25,199 -> 00:00:25,760] 嗯
[00:00:25,760 -> 00:00:28,679] 那坦白的彼岸是什么
[00:00:28,679 -> 00:00:29,480] 结果是
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,040] 我这么跟你讲吧
[00:00:01,040 -> 00:00:01,879] 假设我们是同事
[00:00:01,879 -> 00:00:03,080] 你来我厨房里面的话
[00:00:03,480 -> 00:00:04,440] 我给你一个业务
[00:00:04,759 -> 00:00:05,719] 你不清不白
[00:00:05,719 -> 00:00:06,719] 你不明不白地接受了
[00:00:06,719 -> 00:00:07,080] 比如说
[00:00:07,080 -> 00:00:08,039] 今天你在烤肉
[00:00:08,039 -> 00:00:09,439] 我想要你帮我剥鸡蛋
[00:00:09,839 -> 00:00:11,080] 我需要你帮我水剥蛋
[00:00:11,199 -> 00:00:12,279] 你有可能没有水剥过蛋
[00:00:12,279 -> 00:00:13,080] 我说是
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:14,519] 你就给它剥
[00:00:14,519 -> 00:00:15,240] 剥成垃圾
[00:00:15,400 -> 00:00:16,079] 然后我问你
[00:00:16,160 -> 00:00:17,199] 你这些东西你做了吗
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:18,120] 你这些东西你做了吗
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:19,320] 你有可能
[00:00:22,760 -> 00:00:24,160] 一位好厨师
[00:00:24,160 -> 00:00:25,359] 会回答这个问题
[00:00:26,320 -> 00:00:27,399] 是的 我做了
[00:00:28,719 -> 00:00:29,199] 对不对
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,879] 一个蠢蠢不顺的文艺青年
[00:00:02,879 -> 00:00:04,160] 是因为没人带过我
[00:00:04,160 -> 00:00:06,480] 我曾经在这个视频上面看的是这样子
[00:00:06,480 -> 00:00:07,360] 所以我放点醋
[00:00:07,360 -> 00:00:08,480] 然后我这么这么做了
[00:00:08,800 -> 00:00:11,119] 我不需要这样的
[00:00:11,519 -> 00:00:12,800] 你这个要求好高
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:15,039] 没有效率的沟通是我唯一一个要求
[00:00:15,439 -> 00:00:16,480] 这个要求很高
[00:00:16,719 -> 00:00:18,239] 这个要求是一个对人的
[00:00:18,239 -> 00:00:18,960] 这个怎么说呢
[00:00:18,960 -> 00:00:19,679] 很综合的要求
[00:00:19,679 -> 00:00:21,199] 不 难不高
[00:00:21,679 -> 00:00:22,960] 难不高
[00:00:24,320 -> 00:00:25,120] 很简单
[00:00:25,120 -> 00:00:26,879] 现在很多人特别是年轻人
[00:00:26,879 -> 00:00:27,839] 我正好跟你反过来
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,680] 我正好想的是不难但高
[00:00:02,680 -> 00:00:04,000] No, it's super difficult
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:07,200] 我当然知道效率的沟通是难的
[00:00:07,559 -> 00:00:10,960] 因为你需要抵抗的是很多人类潜意识
[00:00:10,960 -> 00:00:12,599] 有的反应性情绪
[00:00:12,599 -> 00:00:15,800] 比如说我问你效率的沟通是什么
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:16,600] 你会怎么回答
[00:00:18,399 -> 00:00:19,320] 表达清楚吧
[00:00:19,760 -> 00:00:20,559] Fuck no
[00:00:20,559 -> 00:00:22,160] 有人说有人听结束
[00:00:22,800 -> 00:00:23,920] 这是效率的沟通
[00:00:25,000 -> 00:00:27,199] 剩下都是垃圾都是捡来的事
[00:00:27,600 -> 00:00:29,519] 效率的沟通不是和谐的沟通
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,360] 不是温顺的沟通
[00:00:01,360 -> 00:00:03,080] 不是清透的沟通
[00:00:03,080 -> 00:00:04,400] 只是有人说有人听
[00:00:04,400 -> 00:00:05,320] 明白了之后干事
[00:00:05,320 -> 00:00:07,599] 那个是沟通啊
[00:00:07,599 -> 00:00:09,400] 可是你强调的是效率这个词
[00:00:09,400 -> 00:00:10,759] 没有 效率沟通就是
[00:00:10,759 -> 00:00:12,400] 就是沟通是有人说有人听
[00:00:12,400 -> 00:00:13,279] 但是效率呢
[00:00:13,279 -> 00:00:15,119] 效率的沟通就是有人说有人听
[00:00:15,119 -> 00:00:16,440] 我没有说到后面的行动
[00:00:16,440 -> 00:00:17,760] 我就说这个沟通过程
[00:00:17,760 -> 00:00:19,519] I'm speaking, are you listening?
[00:00:19,519 -> 00:00:21,000] I've said, do you understand?
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:22,000] Yes or no?
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:22,839] Yes? Good.
[00:00:22,839 -> 00:00:24,039] No? I'll repeat myself.
[00:00:24,039 -> 00:00:25,320] 这是效率的沟通
[00:00:25,320 -> 00:00:26,160] 对我来说
[00:00:26,160 -> 00:00:27,280] 没有任何垃圾
[00:00:27,280 -> 00:00:27,960] 没有肥肉
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,339] 咱不说效率的就是沟通的内容了
[00:00:03,339 -> 00:00:04,540] 但是沟通的方式
[00:00:04,540 -> 00:00:07,339] 我在想我们的difference come from什么地方
[00:00:07,339 -> 00:00:10,339] 我觉得还是就是在大厂里面见到了太多这个
[00:00:10,339 -> 00:00:11,539] I'm a blue collar worker
[00:00:11,539 -> 00:00:12,939] That's the difference between you and me
[00:00:12,939 -> 00:00:13,939] 我觉得这不是
[00:00:13,939 -> 00:00:15,939] 这是一个概念上的不一样
[00:00:15,939 -> 00:00:19,140] 但是我从来没有觉得我们的工作的本质是不一样的
[00:00:19,140 -> 00:00:21,440] 但是我会觉得我们的经历不一样
[00:00:21,440 -> 00:00:25,539] 然后我的经历就是我遇到过很多很多的同事
[00:00:25,539 -> 00:00:28,699] 我遇到过那些真的就是很高效
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,879] 就是所谓高效 我的定义是高效沟通这些同事
[00:00:02,879 -> 00:00:05,360] 他们反而一般的位置都会很高
[00:00:05,360 -> 00:00:06,799] 他们的位置会很高
[00:00:06,799 -> 00:00:08,880] 然后他们的沟通是真的有效率
[00:00:08,880 -> 00:00:10,720] 就是真的有内容 就是没有那个fat
[00:00:10,720 -> 00:00:14,080] 然后我会觉得这是一个高的要求
[00:00:14,080 -> 00:00:14,880] 这是为什么
[00:00:14,880 -> 00:00:18,079] 因为他对他的综合素质和他的安全感
[00:00:18,079 -> 00:00:21,519] 包括他建立的feedback
[00:00:21,519 -> 00:00:24,719] 就是在不断的成长过程中建立这些feedback是有关系的
[00:00:24,719 -> 00:00:26,480] So that's another thing
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,439] Why did I say是因为我们工作性质不一样导致的
[00:00:03,439 -> 00:00:06,000] 是因为你是个卖脑子行业出身的人
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:09,800] 你这一辈子经历的东西
[00:00:09,800 -> 00:00:11,599] 你这一辈子所做的准备
[00:00:11,599 -> 00:00:13,400] 都是为了将来卖脑子而生活
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:13,800] 对
[00:00:13,800 -> 00:00:14,199] 是吧
[00:00:14,199 -> 00:00:14,800] 我不是
[00:00:14,800 -> 00:00:16,000] 我是卖肉的
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:16,600] 卖时间的
[00:00:16,600 -> 00:00:18,800] 讲简单就是
[00:00:18,800 -> 00:00:21,000] 理论上来讲
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 只要你脑子好使
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:23,000] 你可以干一辈子
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:24,800] 我脑子再好使
[00:00:24,800 -> 00:00:25,800] 我身体有限
[00:00:25,800 -> 00:00:26,800] 我到了一定岁数
[00:00:26,800 -> 00:00:27,600] 我功率数到了
[00:00:27,600 -> 00:00:28,800] 我得把这车给报废了
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,280] 像个出租车一样
[00:00:01,280 -> 00:00:02,000] 对不对
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:03,040] 那在这个前提之下
[00:00:03,040 -> 00:00:05,559] 我和你各有各的优势和弊端
[00:00:05,559 -> 00:00:06,040] 对不对
[00:00:06,040 -> 00:00:07,519] 我的绝对优势不可反驳的是
[00:00:07,519 -> 00:00:09,519] 我的价值是不需要解释的
[00:00:09,519 -> 00:00:10,480] 对不对
[00:00:10,480 -> 00:00:11,359] 我做东西再难吃
[00:00:11,359 -> 00:00:12,080] 你就把钱给我
[00:00:12,080 -> 00:00:13,080] 对不对
[00:00:13,080 -> 00:00:14,359] 你不能说这句话
[00:00:14,359 -> 00:00:15,160] 只要没人买单
[00:00:15,160 -> 00:00:16,000] 你就是没价值
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:17,199] 不管你主意有多好
[00:00:18,760 -> 00:00:19,839] 我这么说公平吗
[00:00:19,839 -> 00:00:20,480] 我想想
[00:00:20,480 -> 00:00:22,000] 因为你说老陈的时候
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:22,760] 我自己就想
[00:00:22,760 -> 00:00:24,039] 你说老陈就是这个
[00:00:24,039 -> 00:00:27,199] 然后我当时想了一下
[00:00:27,199 -> 00:00:29,000] 我再想想是不是这样子
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 对啊
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,000] 结合体
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:06,000] 对啊
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:08,000] 其实我会把老生的行业认为成更是个服务商
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:10,000] 这也可以算是一种劳动
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:12,000] 因为说白了除非你是创作者
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,000] 就是导演或者是编剧
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:16,000] 对不对你是演员都没有说
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:18,000] 话言权其实除非你是很大牌了
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:20,000] 对不对但普遍来讲除非你是
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 你行业的顶端
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:24,000] 你就是一个服务商
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:26,000] 我可以这么去理解吧
[00:00:26,000 -> 00:00:28,000] 我觉得这个视角很好就是我还是想知道他们本质的区别
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,140] 本质的区别我觉得倒不是体力和脑力
[00:00:03,140 -> 00:00:06,900] 就是你之所以你做多难吃我都来付钱
[00:00:06,900 -> 00:00:08,339] 是因为我提前已经认可了你
[00:00:08,339 -> 00:00:09,000] 我愿意过来
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:11,800] 就是我已经agree to this contract
[00:00:11,800 -> 00:00:12,000] 对吧
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,400] 就是你无论做到多难吃我都会给你钱的
[00:00:14,400 -> 00:00:15,800] 我在来之前都有了
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:17,500] 那为什么会这样子
[00:00:17,500 -> 00:00:19,500] 还是因为我之前就已经认可了你
[00:00:19,500 -> 00:00:20,800] 有一定程度的认可
[00:00:20,800 -> 00:00:22,699] 不不不简单就在于
[00:00:24,500 -> 00:00:26,500] 卖脑子买单是吧
[00:00:26,500 -> 00:00:28,100] 看狗是吧
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,000] 加餐
[00:00:01,000 -> 00:00:02,399] 加餐你说嘛
[00:00:02,399 -> 00:00:03,200] 你喊一声没事
[00:00:03,200 -> 00:00:04,200] 来来来 拿给你
[00:00:04,799 -> 00:00:06,200] 没有关系随便打的
[00:00:06,200 -> 00:00:07,599] 小嫩叶子没事吧
[00:00:07,599 -> 00:00:08,199] 没事
[00:00:12,199 -> 00:00:12,599] 谢谢
[00:00:12,599 -> 00:00:13,400] 客气客气客气
[00:00:13,400 -> 00:00:14,400] 我刚回过来说就是
[00:00:14,400 -> 00:00:16,199] 你这网罩我觉得是这样想的
[00:00:16,199 -> 00:00:17,399] 我这网罩是怎么想的呢
[00:00:17,399 -> 00:00:19,399] 就是是我现在做的所有东西
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:20,399] 必须我的老板买单
[00:00:20,399 -> 00:00:21,399] 然后我的同事买单
[00:00:21,399 -> 00:00:24,000] 但是如果说我们这一行去做创业的话
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:25,399] 他就只需要消费者买单
[00:00:25,399 -> 00:00:26,399] 市场买单就行了
[00:00:26,399 -> 00:00:28,199] 他不需要其他任何人告诉他
[00:00:28,199 -> 00:00:29,600] 这个事可不可行
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,600] 他只要市场告诉他可不客气
[00:00:01,960 -> 00:00:04,799] 你的感觉到这也是市场先告诉你可不客气
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:05,799] 才能赚到钱
[00:00:05,799 -> 00:00:07,799] 其实我可能比你简单多了
[00:00:07,799 -> 00:00:09,199] 我没有考虑那么复杂
[00:00:09,519 -> 00:00:10,599] 我给了你薯条
[00:00:10,599 -> 00:00:11,320] 让你数一数
[00:00:11,320 -> 00:00:12,119] 这是不是薯条
[00:00:12,119 -> 00:00:12,679] 是吧
[00:00:12,679 -> 00:00:13,199] 给钱
[00:00:13,640 -> 00:00:13,800] 对
[00:00:13,800 -> 00:00:15,000] 但是我会来
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:16,640] 就是我不会大街上随便一个人
[00:00:16,640 -> 00:00:17,800] 但是假设我们有个合同
[00:00:17,920 -> 00:00:20,320] 假设我聘请你去帮我做某一个东西
[00:00:20,320 -> 00:00:20,839] 对不对
[00:00:20,839 -> 00:00:23,320] 那你的合格和不合格
[00:00:23,320 -> 00:00:24,640] 是不是要合同里面说的出来
[00:00:24,640 -> 00:00:26,079] 但是其实要是我去纠结的话
[00:00:26,079 -> 00:00:27,600] 我可以纠结成我们谁都说不明白
[00:00:27,600 -> 00:00:28,800] 到底是个啥
[00:00:28,800 -> 00:00:29,239] 是
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,360] unless I bill your hours
[00:00:01,360 -> 00:00:02,319] that's the only way
[00:00:02,319 -> 00:00:03,200] I bill your hours
[00:00:03,200 -> 00:00:06,320] 这是唯一一个方式去确保你能收到钱
[00:00:06,320 -> 00:00:07,519] 那说白了你就是卖脑子
[00:00:07,519 -> 00:00:08,160] 对不对
[00:00:08,160 -> 00:00:09,919] 我觉得确实这是一个spectrum
[00:00:09,919 -> 00:00:11,039] 你在这里我在这里
[00:00:11,039 -> 00:00:12,240] 对我不需要卖脑子
[00:00:12,240 -> 00:00:13,119] 我再大的傻逼
[00:00:13,119 -> 00:00:14,640] 我只要我把吃的递给你了
[00:00:14,640 -> 00:00:15,599] 你就得把钱给我
[00:00:15,599 -> 00:00:17,120] 所以在我们行业里边
[00:00:17,120 -> 00:00:19,039] 我们的沟通不需要有想法
[00:00:19,039 -> 00:00:20,399] 你有想法是负担的
[00:00:20,399 -> 00:00:22,000] 但是我对你的想法不感兴趣
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:23,679] 我对你的创意也不感兴趣
[00:00:23,679 -> 00:00:25,760] 我对你的思维也不感兴趣
[00:00:25,760 -> 00:00:27,359] 你想作为朋友和我聊
[00:00:27,359 -> 00:00:27,839] awesome
[00:00:27,839 -> 00:00:29,199] after work we can talk about it
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 但现在,做我的食物
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:05,000] 很多年轻人他们不能接受
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:08,000] 你来了厨房,你是一个表盘里面的齿轮
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:10,000] 这是说的客气了
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:16,000] 我真的希望
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:18,000] 那里还有更好的厨师
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 他们能够接受厨师的厨艺
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:23,000] 因为我深刻认为
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:25,000] 一个厨师没有经历这种打压
[00:00:25,000 -> 00:00:27,000] 没有经历这个过程去
[00:00:27,000 -> 00:00:29,000] 去认识到他自己不重要
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,480] 他做不出伟大的东西
[00:00:01,480 -> 00:00:02,000] 嗯
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:02,600] 嗯
[00:00:02,600 -> 00:00:02,960] 有没有
[00:00:02,960 -> 00:00:03,960] 他不够谦虚
[00:00:03,960 -> 00:00:04,480] 嗯
[00:00:05,120 -> 00:00:05,879] 但现在的
[00:00:05,879 -> 00:00:06,400] 所
[00:00:06,799 -> 00:00:08,320] 但是话反过来说
[00:00:08,320 -> 00:00:09,599] 年代放弃了我
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:11,320] 不是我看不起年代
[00:00:11,839 -> 00:00:13,160] 你觉得年代放弃了你
[00:00:13,160 -> 00:00:14,759] 我代表了上一代的厨师了
[00:00:15,320 -> 00:00:16,559] 不是这一代的厨师了
[00:00:16,920 -> 00:00:17,800] 这一代的厨师
[00:00:17,800 -> 00:00:18,519] 他这个岁数的
[00:00:18,519 -> 00:00:19,239] 19 20
[00:00:19,239 -> 00:00:20,679] 19岁20出头的
[00:00:20,879 -> 00:00:22,000] 懂得比我多
[00:00:22,280 -> 00:00:23,519] 会的比我多
[00:00:23,719 -> 00:00:24,800] 刀工比我好
[00:00:24,800 -> 00:00:26,079] 工具比我齐
[00:00:26,280 -> 00:00:27,079] 比我在乎
[00:00:27,079 -> 00:00:27,879] 比我有追求
[00:00:27,879 -> 00:00:28,679] 比我有初心
[00:00:28,679 -> 00:00:29,480] 比我有理想
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,399] 比我有想法 比我有梦想
[00:00:01,399 -> 00:00:01,800] 好像是
[00:00:01,800 -> 00:00:02,799] 都比我多
[00:00:03,359 -> 00:00:04,599] 他就是不乐意
[00:00:05,080 -> 00:00:07,280] 他就是不乐意干活
[00:00:09,880 -> 00:00:11,000] 什么都会
[00:00:11,000 -> 00:00:12,199] 就是不乐意干活
[00:00:12,439 -> 00:00:15,839] 因为他们不想接受有人反驳他的可能性
[00:00:16,239 -> 00:00:18,440] 他们觉得被反驳是一种攻击
[00:00:18,839 -> 00:00:19,719] 是一种难受
[00:00:20,120 -> 00:00:20,559] fuck no
[00:00:20,559 -> 00:00:22,640] a real cook loves a good fight
[00:00:23,239 -> 00:00:24,399] we love a good fight
[00:00:24,679 -> 00:00:25,600] 要不然你来上班干嘛
[00:00:27,399 -> 00:00:28,160] 你现在还打拳吗
[00:00:28,559 -> 00:00:29,079] 没有了
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,399] 我脱臼了之后我只能练了
[00:00:01,399 -> 00:00:02,200] 我不能去打赛了
[00:00:02,200 -> 00:00:02,879] 现在这是脱臼
[00:00:02,879 -> 00:00:04,400] 我两个天我一直都脱臼
[00:00:04,400 -> 00:00:05,120] 脱臼过好几次了
[00:00:05,120 -> 00:00:06,200] 我这个是习惯而已
[00:00:06,200 -> 00:00:07,480] 挂着 舒服
[00:00:08,919 -> 00:00:10,199] 好的 我的问题问完了
[00:00:10,199 -> 00:00:11,119] 问完了是吧
[00:00:11,119 -> 00:00:12,800] 对 你有没有什么想问的
[00:00:13,240 -> 00:00:14,400] Yeah I actually do
[00:00:18,079 -> 00:00:19,280] Why physics
[00:00:19,679 -> 00:00:20,920] 你说你从物理学开始的
[00:00:20,920 -> 00:00:23,000] 因为小时候在国内读书
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:23,879] 本科是去了美国
[00:00:23,879 -> 00:00:25,640] 但是小时候是在国内读的高中
[00:00:25,640 -> 00:00:27,519] 就那个时候只有物理
[00:00:27,519 -> 00:00:29,440] 是一个真正让你学原理的东西
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,120] I see, I see, I see
[00:00:01,120 -> 00:00:03,080] 其他的就是化学
[00:00:03,080 -> 00:00:03,879] No offense
[00:00:03,879 -> 00:00:07,040] 但是但是我觉得他是在总结表象
[00:00:07,040 -> 00:00:08,240] 他没有告诉我本质
[00:00:08,240 -> 00:00:12,000] 对就像就像那种教你纠正体态
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:13,439] 教你拉伸的那些视频一样
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:15,679] 他其实在展现他这个人有多柔软
[00:00:15,679 -> 00:00:16,879] 他其实没有跟你说为什么
[00:00:16,879 -> 00:00:18,480] I understand, cool
[00:00:18,879 -> 00:00:19,960] It's not offensive to me
[00:00:19,960 -> 00:00:20,399] I don't give a shit
[00:00:20,399 -> 00:00:21,800] I think chemistry is fucking boring
[00:00:22,280 -> 00:00:23,559] 我爸也是化学老师
[00:00:23,559 -> 00:00:26,480] 所以对对我来说化学就是我们尽可能编了一个方式
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:28,160] 去解释一些我们本质上
[00:00:28,160 -> 00:00:29,199] 生物很多时候也是这样
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 包括他们在博士时候做的research
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,559] 后来物理后来博士的最多做了很多research
[00:00:04,559 -> 00:00:05,280] 也是这样子的
[00:00:05,280 -> 00:00:06,320] 所以说我就不喜欢
[00:00:06,320 -> 00:00:08,679] 没有我一直也很喜欢物理的
[00:00:08,679 -> 00:00:11,039] 我喜欢物理的核心
[00:00:11,039 -> 00:00:12,480] 因为我不知道我说的对不对
[00:00:12,480 -> 00:00:13,759] 但是我看我能不能表达清楚
[00:00:13,759 -> 00:00:17,920] 就是物理在科学当中是唯一一个预留了
[00:00:17,920 -> 00:00:21,320] 就是信仰的可能性的一门科学
[00:00:24,120 -> 00:00:24,879] 对
[00:00:24,879 -> 00:00:26,800] 但是我觉得他不是
[00:00:26,800 -> 00:00:28,760] 就是你这句话本身是对的
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,319] 但是你拿来跟其他的学科比较的话
[00:00:03,319 -> 00:00:05,320] 我觉得其他学科还没有上升到这个高度
[00:00:05,320 -> 00:00:07,559] 就不是物理唯一是预留了
[00:00:07,559 -> 00:00:11,279] 而是只有物理它才到了discuss 要信仰的这个程度
[00:00:11,279 -> 00:00:13,039] 因为有些东西我们不能解释
[00:00:13,480 -> 00:00:16,039] 我其实是有一整套完整的玄学世界观的
[00:00:16,039 -> 00:00:18,480] 这和我自己学的物理是完全自洽的
[00:00:18,480 -> 00:00:19,480] 明白
[00:00:19,480 -> 00:00:20,640] 我觉得就对了
[00:00:20,640 -> 00:00:22,239] 它是预留这个空间
[00:00:22,239 -> 00:00:23,280] 我喜欢
[00:00:23,280 -> 00:00:24,079] 酷
[00:00:24,079 -> 00:00:24,679] 太棒了
[00:00:25,879 -> 00:00:27,199] 但是这个问题很神奇
[00:00:27,199 -> 00:00:29,359] 这个问题是应该是我第一次有人问我
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 没有因为我
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:03,000] 我
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,000] 就像我说的
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:05,000] 我不喜欢太绝对的任何东西
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:06,000] 但是这很冲突了
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:07,000] 我自己也很冲突
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:08,000] 因为就像我说的
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:10,000] 我猜我们俩能同意吗
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:12,000] 就是科学的进步的唯一一个方式
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,000] 就是不停的推翻我们昨天的认知
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:15,000] 仅此而已
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:17,000] 就是我希望我的同事同胞同行
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:18,000] 能各种怼我
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:19,000] 把我怼成一个更明白的人
[00:00:19,000 -> 00:00:20,000] 我们互相互怼
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 怼到我们把这个事琢磨明白为止
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:23,000] 对
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:24,000] 我今天是来之前还给我
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:28,000] 就是我上个周花了很长的一段时间
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,339] 寫了一個工作文檔叫如何通過辯論找到我們前線的方向
[00:00:04,339 -> 00:00:06,799] 然後還就是做了一個例子
[00:00:06,799 -> 00:00:09,980] 去用一個滿長的辯論寫成文檔
[00:00:09,980 -> 00:00:12,279] 我覺得這個是很重要的
[00:00:12,279 -> 00:00:13,279] 很神奇
[00:00:14,279 -> 00:00:14,779] 所以
[00:00:15,580 -> 00:00:16,579] 另一個關於數據的問題
[00:00:16,579 -> 00:00:17,579] 你把這個放進去還是不放進去
[00:00:17,579 -> 00:00:18,579] 是你自己的事
[00:00:18,579 -> 00:00:21,280] 我一直對數據科學很有興趣
[00:00:24,280 -> 00:00:26,280] 我不代表絕大多數的數據科學家
[00:00:26,280 -> 00:00:28,480] 我不代表絕大多數的數據科學家
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,659] 那不重要
[00:00:01,659 -> 00:00:02,660] 所以
[00:00:04,860 -> 00:00:06,000] 我看我理解对了没有
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:09,199] 数学只是一个
[00:00:09,199 -> 00:00:12,900] 有关于一个规定的资料的结合
[00:00:12,900 -> 00:00:14,400] 那是大约
[00:00:14,400 -> 00:00:15,960] 结合是什么意思
[00:00:15,960 -> 00:00:17,000] 总结
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:17,600] 不是
[00:00:17,600 -> 00:00:18,199] 不是吗
[00:00:18,199 -> 00:00:19,100] 不是
[00:00:19,100 -> 00:00:19,699] 不是
[00:00:19,699 -> 00:00:20,300] 不是是吧
[00:00:20,300 -> 00:00:21,059] 不是
[00:00:21,059 -> 00:00:21,300] 好
[00:00:21,300 -> 00:00:23,300] 所以说出来像我五岁的样子
[00:00:23,300 -> 00:00:23,500] 对
[00:00:23,500 -> 00:00:26,059] 我觉得有三种吧
[00:00:26,059 -> 00:00:27,800] 有三种就是
[00:00:27,800 -> 00:00:28,960] 就是从你的上面延伸
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,120] 其实还有一个数据工程
[00:00:01,120 -> 00:00:03,480] 那就是把数据给想方设法的给总结好
[00:00:03,480 -> 00:00:04,679] 让大家能快速的调用
[00:00:04,679 -> 00:00:08,679] 但是如果说就是把这个数据make sense of数据这件事情
[00:00:08,679 -> 00:00:10,039] 我觉得有三种方式
[00:00:10,039 -> 00:00:11,279] 第一个就是做分析
[00:00:11,279 -> 00:00:13,560] 就是你去像你刚刚说的总结是吧
[00:00:13,560 -> 00:00:15,080] 然后用不同的角度去看它
[00:00:15,080 -> 00:00:17,719] 但是不同的角度会带来不同的insight
[00:00:17,719 -> 00:00:19,399] 就是你怎么去比较
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:22,280] 举个例子讲就是Facebook的后台和B站的后台
[00:00:22,280 -> 00:00:25,359] B站的后台会给你用一堆角度去解释
[00:00:25,359 -> 00:00:26,839] 你根本就不需要知道的知识
[00:00:26,839 -> 00:00:28,839] 比如说你在生活区排名第几
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,200] 你在这个你过去发了多少视频多少个view
[00:00:03,200 -> 00:00:04,200] 这东西我不care
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:05,400] 不能带来人过来吃
[00:00:05,400 -> 00:00:08,400] 对但是Facebook的后台我不知道你用吗
[00:00:08,400 -> 00:00:10,400] So many years no
[00:00:10,400 -> 00:00:12,000] 我给你看一下他的后台
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:13,800] 后台最重要的一个东西
[00:00:13,800 -> 00:00:15,800] 就是我在发了一个视频以后
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:17,399] 他会说这个排名
[00:00:17,399 -> 00:00:18,399] 但是你看这个
[00:00:18,399 -> 00:00:20,600] YouTube我刚说Facebook
[00:00:20,600 -> 00:00:21,800] YouTube不好意思
[00:00:21,800 -> 00:00:23,800] 但是他这个是前30分钟30小时
[00:00:23,800 -> 00:00:26,000] 就是这10个视频的所有的
[00:00:26,000 -> 00:00:29,800] 他们truncate前三小时30分钟的view是什么
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,200] 然后我们就非常清楚的知道你的这个视频
[00:00:03,200 -> 00:00:06,200] 在这些视频里边的这个相对排名是什么
[00:00:06,200 -> 00:00:07,759] 尤其24小时之后
[00:00:07,759 -> 00:00:08,839] 因为都是过了一天嘛
[00:00:08,839 -> 00:00:10,519] 它的时差也搞定了
[00:00:10,519 -> 00:00:14,359] 你就能知道你这个视频的relative performance
[00:00:14,359 -> 00:00:18,800] 所以它就是一个很好的总结数据的角度
[00:00:18,800 -> 00:00:21,320] 这个是我觉得分析的一个很精致的东西
[00:00:21,320 -> 00:00:24,719] 然后Sense它有很多modeling或者怎样
[00:00:24,719 -> 00:00:26,719] 我觉得更多的是自动化决策
[00:00:26,719 -> 00:00:29,719] 尤其是当这个世界和我们用的产品
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,560] 很复杂的时候
[00:00:01,560 -> 00:00:03,040] 比如说抖音要给你推荐什么
[00:00:03,040 -> 00:00:06,280] 它是没有办法通过人的这个思路去的
[00:00:06,280 -> 00:00:07,519] 它只能用机器
[00:00:07,519 -> 00:00:10,720] 那你怎么样子去把人的一个Ref的Direction
[00:00:10,720 -> 00:00:12,880] 变成一个机器的方向
[00:00:12,880 -> 00:00:14,839] 让机器去把它优化的更好
[00:00:14,839 -> 00:00:16,960] 这个我觉得是需要数据和数据科学来做
[00:00:16,960 -> 00:00:18,719] 因为这个一直是一个我很好奇的点子
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:22,079] 就是以我所知机器理论上来讲
[00:00:23,440 -> 00:00:24,719] 不能学习
[00:00:24,719 -> 00:00:27,920] 就至少不能按照我们的学习方式去学习
[00:00:27,920 -> 00:00:29,480] 他们只能试错
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,680] 不 他不能按照我们的学习方式学习
[00:00:02,680 -> 00:00:05,240] 但是我们的学习方式是什么这个东西也很难说
[00:00:05,240 -> 00:00:09,320] 对 我相信绝大多数人的这个学习方式其实还是鹦鹉学蛇
[00:00:09,320 -> 00:00:11,519] 只要他的学习pattern是鹦鹉学蛇
[00:00:11,519 -> 00:00:12,599] 机器一定能学
[00:00:12,599 -> 00:00:14,519] 只不过他学到东西可能和我们不一样
[00:00:14,519 -> 00:00:17,239] 就是你给一个机器任何一列random number
[00:00:17,239 -> 00:00:19,519] 然后你说你去找他们的pattern
[00:00:19,519 -> 00:00:20,839] 机器都能给你找出来
[00:00:20,839 -> 00:00:23,559] 但是我们同时我们去给他一个比如说
[00:00:23,559 -> 00:00:25,960] 这样的东西它是一个盘子
[00:00:25,960 -> 00:00:27,879] 然后让他给他100万个盘子
[00:00:27,879 -> 00:00:29,640] 然后给他100万个其他东西让他分
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,040] 他就能分出来
[00:00:01,040 -> 00:00:04,240] 虽然他可能去怎么分盘子的方式
[00:00:04,240 -> 00:00:04,759] 和我们不一样
[00:00:04,759 -> 00:00:05,679] 但是他能分出来
[00:00:05,679 -> 00:00:06,480] 这样的话
[00:00:06,480 -> 00:00:08,320] 他在工作中的时候就很有用
[00:00:08,320 -> 00:00:10,240] 因为我们不需要知道他怎么做到这件事了
[00:00:10,240 -> 00:00:11,039] 但是他能做到
[00:00:12,359 -> 00:00:14,480] 而且他能很快速高效的做到
[00:00:14,480 -> 00:00:17,280] 并且他能做到很多我们自己理解不了的东西
[00:00:17,280 -> 00:00:19,640] 就比如说之前的AI绘画
[00:00:19,640 -> 00:00:21,760] 就是AI绘画大家看了以后是
[00:00:21,760 -> 00:00:23,199] 哇这个东西好不一样
[00:00:23,199 -> 00:00:24,800] 但是因为我们的绘画
[00:00:24,800 -> 00:00:26,960] 已经被我们的思维方式给局限了
[00:00:26,960 -> 00:00:29,920] 可能做菜就是你到时候让机器来做菜是吧
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 你就给他所有的食材所有的东西
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:03,700] 然后你让一个人说这个好吃这个不好吃
[00:00:03,700 -> 00:00:04,700] 这个好吃这个不好吃
[00:00:04,700 -> 00:00:07,000] 机器到时候应该可以把所有的ingredient
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:07,799] 对啊 所以是说
[00:00:07,799 -> 00:00:09,199] 就是有一个规定
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,480] Right? This is yes and no, yes and no, right or wrong, right or wrong
[00:00:03,480 -> 00:00:04,719] 然后从不同的
[00:00:04,719 -> 00:00:06,200] Maybe he'll try it a different way next time
[00:00:06,200 -> 00:00:07,160] Yes or no? No?
[00:00:07,160 -> 00:00:08,080] Okay, I'll try it another way
[00:00:08,080 -> 00:00:08,880] Yes or no? No?
[00:00:08,880 -> 00:00:09,599] Okay, I'll try it another way
[00:00:09,599 -> 00:00:10,640] Yes this time? Awesome
[00:00:10,640 -> 00:00:11,119] What did I do?
[00:00:11,119 -> 00:00:11,960] That's how it learns
[00:00:11,960 -> 00:00:12,800] Oh, that's how it learns
[00:00:12,800 -> 00:00:14,480] 对 就是你给他一堆X
[00:00:14,480 -> 00:00:15,400] 然后和一个Y
[00:00:15,400 -> 00:00:16,800] 给他一堆X和一个Y
[00:00:16,800 -> 00:00:18,719] 然后你告诉他这个Y对应的是什么
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:19,480] 这个Y对应的是什么
[00:00:19,480 -> 00:00:19,960] 明白
[00:00:19,960 -> 00:00:21,440] 再次你再给他一堆新的X
[00:00:21,440 -> 00:00:23,039] 他就告诉你他应该对应什么Y
[00:00:23,039 -> 00:00:26,079] 但是考核那个机器人也是个机器人吗
[00:00:26,079 -> 00:00:27,320] 还是考核必须得是个人
[00:00:27,320 -> 00:00:28,320] 就是我们的模型啦
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,240] 就是我们先给他一堆数据是吧
[00:00:02,240 -> 00:00:04,160] 我说你在这里边learn this pattern
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:06,200] 对吧这个数据里面有一堆X和一堆Y
[00:00:06,240 -> 00:00:07,839] 我是简化的还有各种其他的
[00:00:07,879 -> 00:00:09,919] 就是就有一堆X和他们对应的Y
[00:00:09,960 -> 00:00:10,919] learn this pattern
[00:00:10,960 -> 00:00:13,320] 然后我说我现在给你一堆新的数据
[00:00:13,320 -> 00:00:14,919] 你来try to predict this Y
[00:00:14,960 -> 00:00:17,559] 但是我其实知道ground truth about this Y
[00:00:17,600 -> 00:00:19,600] 然后我就说你对了多少
[00:00:19,879 -> 00:00:23,199] 你的机器就想方设法的去增加你的正确率
[00:00:23,239 -> 00:00:24,679] 如果你的正确率足够高了
[00:00:24,679 -> 00:00:25,719] 那我就可以拿一堆
[00:00:25,719 -> 00:00:27,359] 我自己也不知道结果的东西
[00:00:27,359 -> 00:00:28,679] 然后让你去做了
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 我明白了
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,000] 这就不像人类了
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:05,000] 是
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:06,000] 酷
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:07,000] 这是英文学说
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:08,000] 超酷
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:09,000] 第三种
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:10,000] 是我这种
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:14,000] 我觉得就是我们会想方设法的从这个数据中去学习这个世界的原理
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:16,000] 然后建立自己的心理模式
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:18,000] 然后去做一些判断
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:19,000] 好的
[00:00:19,000 -> 00:00:20,000] 酷
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:21,000] 心理模式
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:22,000] 我喜欢这个词
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:23,000] 很可爱
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:27,000] 没有其他的词可以去很好的总结它
[00:00:27,000 -> 00:00:28,000] 你还要再喝一杯咖啡吗
[00:00:28,000 -> 00:00:29,000] 不用了
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,800] 我能帮你收拾点盘子不
[00:00:01,800 -> 00:00:02,960] 可以的 谢谢
[00:00:02,960 -> 00:00:04,040] 你撒手 滚
[00:00:05,759 -> 00:00:06,960] 老需要这份工作的
[00:00:06,960 -> 00:00:08,359] 刚才还轮到你帮忙的
[00:00:08,359 -> 00:00:09,640] 这乱了天了你
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:16,480] 我聊完了
[00:00:17,079 -> 00:00:17,760] 我聊完了
[00:00:17,760 -> 00:00:18,719] 聊完了是吧
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:19,039] 对
[00:00:19,039 -> 00:00:20,239] 太棒了 酷
[00:00:20,239 -> 00:00:20,760] 谢谢
[00:00:20,760 -> 00:00:22,000] 这次聊得真好
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:22,399] 谢谢你
[00:00:22,399 -> 00:00:23,519] 谢谢你这么多时间
[00:00:23,519 -> 00:00:24,199] 谢谢
[00:00:24,199 -> 00:00:25,199] 我们下次可以
[00:00:25,199 -> 00:00:26,320] 对 我没有想到能
[00:00:26,320 -> 00:00:29,760] 我没有想到就是今天会有这种浓度的聊
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,280] 对因为我看了你的视频
[00:00:01,280 -> 00:00:02,200] 你能够看我的视频
[00:00:02,200 -> 00:00:03,399] 我有啊我有啊我有啊
[00:00:03,399 -> 00:00:04,559] 但是这怎么说呢
[00:00:04,559 -> 00:00:06,639] 就是我不知道是因为你的对方
[00:00:06,639 -> 00:00:07,639] 大概率是你的对方
[00:00:07,639 -> 00:00:09,880] 就他们回答方式有一点
[00:00:10,359 -> 00:00:10,880] 礼貌
[00:00:11,759 -> 00:00:12,240] 呃
[00:00:12,240 -> 00:00:12,720] 回问
[00:00:12,720 -> 00:00:13,439] 克制了
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:14,279] 克制对
[00:00:14,279 -> 00:00:16,199] 就是我来之前我就说
[00:00:16,199 -> 00:00:18,160] 我没有跟这么high energy
[00:00:18,160 -> 00:00:19,839] 或者说这么直接的人对话
[00:00:19,839 -> 00:00:20,399] 嗯
[00:00:20,399 -> 00:00:21,839] 不对因为就像我说嘛
[00:00:21,839 -> 00:00:23,039] 该怎么说呢
[00:00:23,760 -> 00:00:27,600] 要是我们的缘分
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,839] 是允许我们之间非常讨厌的话
[00:00:03,839 -> 00:00:04,879] 我情愿早点知道
[00:00:04,879 -> 00:00:06,080] 对吧
[00:00:06,080 -> 00:00:06,599] 对
[00:00:06,599 -> 00:00:10,800] 我更想知道我们很讨厌我们很快很慢
[00:00:10,800 -> 00:00:11,800] 是这样子
[00:00:11,800 -> 00:00:12,039] 是吗
[00:00:12,039 -> 00:00:13,800] 没必要去说啥
[00:00:13,800 -> 00:00:16,719] 谢谢您今天花时间过来
[00:00:16,719 -> 00:00:18,719] 我跟你分享一下我们的经历
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:20,079] Fuck no
[00:00:20,079 -> 00:00:20,960] 可以可以
[00:00:20,960 -> 00:00:25,440] 我对这种其实对我对绝大多数怎么说呢
[00:00:25,440 -> 00:00:26,920] 就是像你这种的厨师
[00:00:26,920 -> 00:00:28,640] 都有一种莫名其妙的缘分
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,480] 但是有一些就是当时在夏土有一个厨师
[00:00:03,480 -> 00:00:04,400] 他是一个菲律宾人
[00:00:04,400 -> 00:00:07,599] 然后从San Diego去夏土去做
[00:00:07,599 -> 00:00:08,720] 就后来得癌症
[00:00:08,720 -> 00:00:10,240] 然后第二年就去世了
[00:00:10,240 -> 00:00:10,880] 就嗝了
[00:00:10,880 -> 00:00:11,279] 对
[00:00:11,279 -> 00:00:13,039] 蛮难过的
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:15,800] 但是总之就是确实有很多莫名其妙的缘分
[00:00:15,800 -> 00:00:18,559] 对厨师普遍来讲
[00:00:18,559 -> 00:00:22,440] 我这一辈子见过最最肯想的都是厨师
[00:00:22,440 -> 00:00:25,879] 那很多人可以就是很多人可以想
[00:00:25,879 -> 00:00:29,559] 而且很多人都是经过你说的这种训练
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,319] 就是在这种很高压的环境下去工作
[00:00:02,319 -> 00:00:05,000] 然后他们的性格都会相对更那个
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:05,559] 同时呢
[00:00:06,320 -> 00:00:07,200] effective一些
[00:00:07,200 -> 00:00:09,160] 对 因为到一定程度你会意识到
[00:00:09,519 -> 00:00:11,400] 对 是我干的 你能把我吃了吗
[00:00:11,400 -> 00:00:12,759] no cool let me get back to work
[00:00:13,359 -> 00:00:14,519] you're no longer afraid
[00:00:14,519 -> 00:00:16,320] like what the fuck is there to be afraid of
[00:00:17,160 -> 00:00:18,120] 这种安全感很重要
[00:00:18,120 -> 00:00:19,719] that's why i love
[00:00:19,719 -> 00:00:21,859] that's why i love mexican cooks from america
[00:00:22,199 -> 00:00:23,859] oh those boys work so hard
[00:00:26,519 -> 00:00:27,519] did you fucking do this
[00:00:27,519 -> 00:00:28,800] yeah make it again
[00:00:28,820 -> 00:00:29,420] got it
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] 干杯 兄弟
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,000] 你看
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:06,000] 我是美国人
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:12,000] 好的 谢谢
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:14,000] 那我们这期视频到这里
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:16,000] 太棒了 谢谢你
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:18,000] 你这些照片不拍了吗
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:20,000] 不拍了 他不在乎这些
