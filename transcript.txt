[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,660] All right, Nick. Oh, hi! Welcome. Thank you. I'd be happy to describe things if you'd
[00:00:07,660 -> 00:00:14,619] like or we can talk about whatever you want. Can you introduce me to what's in the
[00:00:14,619 -> 00:00:20,219] mystery box? Yeah, let's start there. So what I've done is put together a
[00:00:20,219 -> 00:00:26,980] selection of mostly wine. There's a sake here as well and it has a range of
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,160] flavors, styles, and different countries.
[00:00:04,160 -> 00:00:08,599] So the first is this champagne, Jean Jocelyn,
[00:00:08,599 -> 00:00:13,599] and it's a grower champagne, meaning the winery
[00:00:14,080 -> 00:00:16,079] grew the grapes, saw them through the whole
[00:00:16,079 -> 00:00:19,719] production process, and then made the wine.
[00:00:19,719 -> 00:00:21,160] So it's a small producer.
[00:00:21,160 -> 00:00:25,559] It's a special term because that is not a norm
[00:00:25,559 -> 00:00:27,359] of how they do champagnes?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,839] I would say that the majority of brands that are most famous,
[00:00:03,839 -> 00:00:08,880] like Dom Perignon, Krug, Ruevenaert, Bollinger,
[00:00:08,880 -> 00:00:14,320] Tettinger, they are so big that they
[00:00:14,320 -> 00:00:18,280] buy a lot of the fruit from small growers
[00:00:18,280 -> 00:00:20,359] around the region.
[00:00:20,359 -> 00:00:24,800] So it's almost like a restaurant who buys their ingredients
[00:00:24,800 -> 00:00:26,480] from suppliers.
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:28,320] Instead of they grow the produce.
[00:00:28,320 -> 00:00:29,559] Like Blue Hill.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,919] like Blue Hill Stone Barns would be sort of like this grower producer. I see.
[00:00:04,919 -> 00:00:10,960] That's kind of what makes these growers special and they make wines that are a
[00:00:10,960 -> 00:00:17,920] bit more delicate I'd say than the big houses. So the Dom Perignon
[00:00:17,920 -> 00:00:23,640] and Bollinger, they make delicious wines but they're really showy wines. I see.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,000] They're impressive. The growers are a bit more focused and detailed.
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:14,000] Yeah, I guess then for an occasion like a wedding, maybe you want the showy ones.
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:19,000] It's not necessarily, you know, they serve different purposes.
[00:00:19,000 -> 00:00:25,000] But for this one, maybe you just want to enjoy at home and figure out all the intricacy.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,160] Yeah it's true. Although for your wedding, we drank all the champagne that was at
[00:00:05,160 -> 00:00:10,119] your wedding so we don't have any more, but it was a 2012 vintage Blanc de Blanc
[00:00:10,119 -> 00:00:16,480] from a grower. So even within grower wines they can make showy examples. It's
[00:00:16,480 -> 00:00:20,519] usually just the top-of-the-line wines from growers are the most showy. Yeah.
[00:00:20,519 -> 00:00:26,879] So yeah this is a classic blend so it has... it's actually not a blend. It's all
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,799] Pinot Noir, so this is what they call Blanc de Noir, and it's where you take a dark skin
[00:00:04,799 -> 00:00:11,359] grape and the inside of the grape is clear juice, so they press it very gently and allow
[00:00:11,359 -> 00:00:15,000] the juice to make a white wine from a red grape.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:16,600] So it's a special technique.
[00:00:16,600 -> 00:00:22,120] Yeah, it's all kinds of special and you just want to try it immediately.
[00:00:22,120 -> 00:00:23,800] I know, it's hard to wait.
[00:00:23,800 -> 00:00:27,079] Do you recommend to wait or I can drink it right away?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,299] I've designed the mystery box so that all the wines are within an accessible drinking
[00:00:05,299 -> 00:00:07,299] window right now.
[00:00:07,299 -> 00:00:13,839] Or you could choose to wait and continue aging if you wanted to, but it's not a requirement.
[00:00:13,839 -> 00:00:22,239] So it's true that with a lot of wines, they encourage waiting, but a lot of these have
[00:00:22,239 -> 00:00:25,760] a little bit of age on them and should be really good right now.
[00:00:25,760 -> 00:00:27,620] She actually do know that.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:08,400] give me a bottle as a gift. Oh, really? Yeah, he told me to wait. Guess which bottle he picked?
[00:00:09,839 -> 00:00:19,359] Was it a champagne? Yeah. Oh, I know he likes Krug quite a bit. Yeah. Oh, look at that. That is the
[00:00:19,359 -> 00:00:29,440] Shoyuan Krug vintage. Yes. I wonder where he got it. Yeah. Oh, is it hard to get it? It's very rare.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] Oh, I knew it's good and rare, but I don't know. It's very rare.
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:07,000] Well, you'll see that there's...
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:08,000] How much is the bottle?
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:11,000] Oh, it's not about the price, but it's very special.
[00:00:11,000 -> 00:00:13,000] Yeah, it's about that.
[00:00:13,000 -> 00:00:20,000] Wenxin, Nick just told us this is very rare and very difficult to get, the gift from Xin.
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:23,000] Yeah, this one.
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:24,000] Oh, wow.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,679] Krug vintage and that's the 2008 which is again it's a wine that you could
[00:00:05,679 -> 00:00:10,080] drink now but it has a long aging potential and be a great anniversary
[00:00:10,080 -> 00:00:15,279] type of wine or something to enjoy on a special moment. So you mentioned
[00:00:15,279 -> 00:00:27,039] Krug vintage? Yeah so wines from Champagne that carry a single year
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,599] on the label are usually more special. Those are single vintage wines versus
[00:00:04,599 -> 00:00:08,679] something like the Jocelynne here is non-vintage. It might have from different
[00:00:08,679 -> 00:00:14,199] three or four years blended together. I see. And part of the reason there is that
[00:00:14,199 -> 00:00:19,280] the Champagne region is the furthest north in France and the weather is the
[00:00:19,280 -> 00:00:23,440] most challenging. Yeah. So they usually blend multiple years to achieve some
[00:00:23,440 -> 00:00:27,679] consistency. Yeah. And only a couple times a decade can they make a single vintage
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:09,900] wine. Oh, okay. And so this 2008 rested in the Krug cellars until I believe 2021 or
[00:00:09,900 -> 00:00:16,739] 2022, so it has over a decade of aging at the winery until release. Okay, this
[00:00:16,739 -> 00:00:22,460] became available two years ago. Yes, and it's very special. Thanks, Chin.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] Thanks, Chin.
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:03,000] Yep.
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:04,000] Yep.
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:05,000] There you go.
[00:00:05,000 -> 00:00:08,000] How did you get access to this?
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:18,000] Well, the way that it works for my business is I work with the supplier all year long
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:21,000] and buy different wines that they recommend.
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:27,000] And then through that relationship and showing loyalty and partnership,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,160] they say, okay, to reward that, we will allow you to buy a small amount of special wines
[00:00:06,160 -> 00:00:07,160] every so often.
[00:00:07,160 -> 00:00:09,960] So that's what they call allocation in the business.
[00:00:09,960 -> 00:00:12,199] That's what I heard as well.
[00:00:12,199 -> 00:00:15,720] They buy a lot of and they give you something special.
[00:00:15,720 -> 00:00:19,399] Yeah, as a thank you and as a reward.
[00:00:19,399 -> 00:00:24,640] So I was lucky to get six bottles for the year of 2008.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,879] And so what a treat.
[00:00:04,879 -> 00:00:05,960] Yeah.
[00:00:05,960 -> 00:00:10,240] So the next thing that we have here is not a wine, but it's a sake.
[00:00:10,240 -> 00:00:11,640] Comes from Japan.
[00:00:11,640 -> 00:00:16,519] And this is a sort of like the grower champagne.
[00:00:16,519 -> 00:00:20,440] It's a small producer of sake.
[00:00:20,440 -> 00:00:28,399] And this level of quality is maybe in the top 5% of best quality of any sake that's
[00:00:28,399 -> 00:00:29,399] made.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,360] Usually when we go to a restaurant and get the sake, you know, like the warm sake with
[00:00:05,360 -> 00:00:13,199] your sushi or anything like that, that can be delicious, but it's a big production beverage
[00:00:13,199 -> 00:00:14,619] versus something that...
[00:00:14,619 -> 00:00:19,719] And sometimes they can be expensive, like not the warm sake, but like the bottled sake,
[00:00:19,719 -> 00:00:23,280] they can be expensive, but still like large production.
[00:00:23,280 -> 00:00:24,280] Exactly.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,919] something like this is a small production and is made in a very
[00:00:05,919 -> 00:00:13,439] traditional way. So this is a... has a lot... the sake terms can get complicated.
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:23,120] It's a Moroccan Namagenshu Junmai Daiginjo. So it's basically a raw
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:09,039] sake. Unfiltered, undiluted, unpasteurized, with no brewers alcohol added, and the
[00:00:09,039 -> 00:00:16,739] rice grain is Daiginjo, meaning the full rice grain has been milled to less than
[00:00:16,739 -> 00:00:22,100] half of its original weight. Yeah, and I like how kind of low-key this bottle is.
[00:00:22,100 -> 00:00:28,539] Yeah, it looks like a very, because it is a cheap cap and just a blue bottle, it
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,000] It looks like very, just about the alcohol, not about the packaging.
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:09,279] Yeah, it's not this really elaborate design.
[00:00:09,279 -> 00:00:12,279] It's a very detailed design, but not showy.
[00:00:12,279 -> 00:00:15,000] Yeah, yeah, detailed but not showy.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:21,000] And this is, you know, sake generally isn't a beverage that's meant to be aged.
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:26,480] There's a few examples that exist like that, but this is one that I would recommend having
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:27,800] in the next few months.
[00:00:27,800 -> 00:00:28,800] Okay.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,040] great with food, whether it's home cooking
[00:00:04,040 -> 00:00:06,280] or you take it out to a nice dinner,
[00:00:06,280 -> 00:00:07,480] it could be really nice.
[00:00:08,359 -> 00:00:12,019] So after the sake here, we have,
[00:00:13,320 -> 00:00:17,120] this is a Beaujolais from a small producer
[00:00:17,120 -> 00:00:18,879] named Jean Fouillard.
[00:00:18,879 -> 00:00:22,320] And in France, there are many different wine regions.
[00:00:22,320 -> 00:00:24,960] The most famous might be Bordeaux.
[00:00:24,960 -> 00:00:26,920] Burgundy is also very famous.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,040] And south of Burgundy, its own region,
[00:00:02,040 -> 00:00:03,520] it's called Beaujolais.
[00:00:03,520 -> 00:00:06,320] They focus on a red grape called Gamay.
[00:00:06,320 -> 00:00:08,439] And just like Pinot Noir,
[00:00:08,439 -> 00:00:11,320] Gamay is a lighter skinned grape variety
[00:00:11,320 -> 00:00:15,539] and is really vibrant, refreshing.
[00:00:15,539 -> 00:00:18,679] And this Beaujolais comes from a single neighborhood
[00:00:18,679 -> 00:00:23,640] called Morgon, which is kind of a prized area
[00:00:23,640 -> 00:00:24,960] within the region.
[00:00:24,960 -> 00:00:27,579] And John Foyard's a famous producer.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,059] So this is just like the Krug, another kind of allocated wine that's a special thing to
[00:00:05,059 -> 00:00:06,059] get.
[00:00:06,059 -> 00:00:07,059] Nice.
[00:00:07,059 -> 00:00:08,060] So, lighter.
[00:00:08,060 -> 00:00:11,060] Oh yeah, go ahead.
[00:00:11,060 -> 00:00:16,100] Yeah, the wax seal, does it really indicate it's a natural one or a raw one?
[00:00:16,100 -> 00:00:19,539] A lot of natural wines will have that wax seal.
[00:00:19,539 -> 00:00:27,500] And I think it's a way of kind of contrasting more...
[00:00:27,500 -> 00:00:28,500] I don't know if...
[00:00:28,500 -> 00:00:29,500] It's a style choice.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,020] It's a style choice.
[00:00:02,020 -> 00:00:05,280] It's more low-tech, I think.
[00:00:05,280 -> 00:00:07,240] That's the way I would describe it,
[00:00:07,240 -> 00:00:10,759] is like the beautiful kind of metal capsules
[00:00:10,759 -> 00:00:13,779] that we see on wines, they're a bit more high-tech,
[00:00:13,779 -> 00:00:16,420] and this is just dipping it in wax.
[00:00:16,420 -> 00:00:18,480] It seems like it's done on the farm.
[00:00:18,480 -> 00:00:19,440] Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:20,480 -> 00:00:23,480] Evoking an old-school sensibility.
[00:00:23,480 -> 00:00:26,120] So I would describe Foyard as being
[00:00:26,120 -> 00:00:28,839] towards that raw wine end of the spectrum,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] but still very clean, vibrant, and fruit forward wine,
[00:00:05,879 -> 00:00:07,940] but with a lot of minerality to it.
[00:00:08,800 -> 00:00:09,640] Okay, yeah.
[00:00:09,640 -> 00:00:10,480] Wanna do that one next?
[00:00:10,480 -> 00:00:13,720] No, I'm just checking if they're all in the frame.
[00:00:13,720 -> 00:00:15,000] Oh, yeah, they are.
[00:00:15,000 -> 00:00:15,839] They are.
[00:00:15,839 -> 00:00:17,000] Yeah.
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:19,780] So we're going to go to a few different countries
[00:00:19,780 -> 00:00:21,140] for the next wines.
[00:00:21,140 -> 00:00:24,440] This is a Malbec from Argentina,
[00:00:24,440 -> 00:00:26,359] and it's in a great window right now.
[00:00:26,359 -> 00:00:27,899] It's 2013 vintage,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,160] So no need to really age it too much longer.
[00:00:03,160 -> 00:00:05,960] I think it would be drinking beautiful right now.
[00:00:05,960 -> 00:00:08,080] And it's from Lujan de Cuyo, which
[00:00:08,080 -> 00:00:11,480] is a neighborhood within Mendoza that is up
[00:00:11,480 -> 00:00:14,599] in the Andes Mountains, very high elevation,
[00:00:14,599 -> 00:00:17,640] gets a lot of sunlight, and creates
[00:00:17,640 -> 00:00:21,239] very concentrated, delectable wines.
[00:00:21,239 -> 00:00:23,559] How would you describe the difference between Mabach
[00:00:23,559 -> 00:00:25,640] and Cabernet Sauvignon?
[00:00:25,640 -> 00:00:28,160] They're both grapes from the same region, Bordeaux,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:08,080] originally, Southwest France, but Cabernet Sauvignon has more structure and that kind
[00:00:08,080 -> 00:00:09,919] of tannin grip.
[00:00:09,919 -> 00:00:16,920] Malbec is softer and rounder and has more of a plush kind of silkiness to it.
[00:00:16,920 -> 00:00:17,920] Yeah.
[00:00:17,920 -> 00:00:26,960] So I would say that Malbec is easy drinking, but also is full-bodied and robust.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,780] doesn't have the same kind of strength or edge as a Cabernet Sauvignon. So it's
[00:00:05,780 -> 00:00:10,419] it's the originally from France but these days the most famous examples are
[00:00:10,419 -> 00:00:14,699] from Argentina. Yeah like when I say Argentina, they're almost always Malbec.
[00:00:14,699 -> 00:00:20,760] Yep there are some other great reds coming out of Argentina but if you were
[00:00:20,760 -> 00:00:25,679] to place a bet you know chances are it's gonna be a Malbec if you're yeah if
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,000] if you're finding one.
[00:00:01,000 -> 00:00:02,000] Cool.
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,919] Next is a Spanish wine.
[00:00:04,919 -> 00:00:14,720] This is from an area called Priorat, and it's in the northeast part of Spain in Catalonia
[00:00:14,720 -> 00:00:16,719] near Barcelona.
[00:00:16,719 -> 00:00:20,480] And it's a famous area for its soil type.
[00:00:20,480 -> 00:00:24,320] It's on this black slate called Licorea.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:08,240] the the soil is just pitch black and the grapes can vary. Often it's Grenache,
[00:00:08,240 -> 00:00:13,439] Carignan, sometimes Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a blend of Grenache and Carignan.
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:18,640] So it's going to be a really big powerful wine that has a lot of
[00:00:18,640 -> 00:00:25,600] earthiness and is great for I'd say like barbecue, smoked meat, just really intense
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,599] savory. Fun party. Yeah you can even do it with hot pot. It could be really cool with
[00:00:04,599 -> 00:00:09,720] hot pot. Oh yeah. Yes spicy food Szechuan. I think
[00:00:09,720 -> 00:00:14,259] Priora with that kind of food is really good. It just gets you like spicy and
[00:00:14,259 -> 00:00:20,160] big one and spicy and big one. All together. Yeah. So good. And then the
[00:00:20,160 -> 00:00:26,760] final one is Italian wine from Tuscany. It's a Chianti Classico and this is
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,700] based on Sangiovese, which is the classic Italian grape, especially from
[00:00:04,700 -> 00:00:11,900] Tuscany. The Winchester birth year wine is also from, is that? Yes, exactly right.
[00:00:11,900 -> 00:00:19,699] So it's a grape that can age really nicely but is pretty accessible in
[00:00:19,699 -> 00:00:26,140] youth and has a lot of herbaceousness and savory tones. So kind of in terms of
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,839] weight of the reds. I'd say the lightest red is the Gamay. I would say the Chianti
[00:00:06,839 -> 00:00:16,480] is next. And then probably the Malbec and then the Priorat. So you can kind of
[00:00:16,480 -> 00:00:23,079] choose a wine based on what occasion that you want to drink it. Like any of
[00:00:23,079 -> 00:00:26,839] these could be good with a meal, but I would say like if you're to drink
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,799] something on its own. Maybe you do the Beaujolais or the Malbec because
[00:00:06,799 -> 00:00:12,400] they're a bit softer. The Chianti and the Priora, I would do with food
[00:00:12,400 -> 00:00:15,919] for sure. But they can all go with a meal as well.
[00:00:15,919 -> 00:00:23,960] Cool. Okay, thank you, Nick. You're welcome. Cheers.
