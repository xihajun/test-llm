[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,560] I get wine offers all day long from importers and suppliers,
[00:00:03,560 -> 00:00:07,360] and I could have 10,000 labels to choose from.
[00:00:07,360 -> 00:00:11,519] And those are just, at any given time, 10,000 labels.
[00:00:11,519 -> 00:00:14,199] So over the course of 24 months,
[00:00:14,199 -> 00:00:15,839] it could be 100,000 different wines.
[00:00:15,839 -> 00:00:19,640] That's what daunting to me or a lot of beginners, right?
[00:00:19,640 -> 00:00:21,640] Like, Bingbing is also an example.
[00:00:21,640 -> 00:00:22,480] Yeah.
[00:00:22,480 -> 00:00:23,320] When we think about the wine,
[00:00:23,320 -> 00:00:24,679] when we look at all the lists,
[00:00:26,239 -> 00:00:27,440] how can we choose?
[00:00:27,440 -> 00:00:28,280] Yeah.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,040] wine store and ask the staff but that person is probably just apprentice or
[00:00:05,040 -> 00:00:09,199] working in this industry for two years. Well and and the person who works in a
[00:00:09,199 -> 00:00:14,480] store could have a very high level of knowledge but they are restrained
[00:00:14,480 -> 00:00:19,440] to whatever the store has at that moment. I have the ability if somebody requests
[00:00:19,440 -> 00:00:24,519] a wine I can I can go to the moon and back to get it. So an example here is
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:09,439] is this wine that a client asked for. This Piedras Blancs is a natural wine from Southern France,
[00:00:10,480 -> 00:00:14,480] and I tried to get it here from my connections in Washington State,
[00:00:15,519 -> 00:00:22,800] but it's such a rare wine that they were sold out. So I went to California and one of my colleagues
[00:00:22,800 -> 00:00:28,800] at a company called Vine and Rare was able to source this for me. So a lot of my success in
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,520] in sourcing wines is through having built a network
[00:00:03,520 -> 00:00:06,740] over the last 10 years in the beverage world.
[00:00:06,740 -> 00:00:07,980] You really?
[00:00:07,980 -> 00:00:10,779] Yeah, really, like Master Sommelier for the people.
[00:00:10,779 -> 00:00:12,660] For the people, I know.
[00:00:12,660 -> 00:00:14,859] It's not Master Sommelier for just-
[00:00:14,859 -> 00:00:18,019] For the fine dining restaurant spending like $1,000.
[00:00:18,019 -> 00:00:21,059] No, I mean, I have really cool wines like Screamy Eagle,
[00:00:21,059 -> 00:00:21,960] but we have one bottle.
[00:00:21,960 -> 00:00:24,859] Like we don't need a ton of Screamy Eagle.
[00:00:24,859 -> 00:00:28,739] I'd rather have a ton of, you know, Walla Walla Syrah
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,000] and Premier Cru Chablis and Aussie Shiraz that's good,
[00:00:05,639 -> 00:00:09,019] that typical people can drink,
[00:00:09,019 -> 00:00:13,220] because that's what I want to drink.
[00:00:13,220 -> 00:00:17,120] So anything that's in my personal collection
[00:00:17,120 -> 00:00:20,480] that we talked about earlier, the wines that I'm drinking,
[00:00:20,480 -> 00:00:21,859] those are the same kinds of wines
[00:00:21,859 -> 00:00:23,600] that I'm selecting for the program.
