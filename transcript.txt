[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,960] So today, I'd like to introduce our speaker, who is also a
[00:00:05,960 -> 00:00:10,599] Cornell student. But right now, he after he graduates from
[00:00:10,599 -> 00:00:17,160] Cornell, he actually has a lot of decisions on how to make a
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:21,239] change from one job to another. He was he had experience in
[00:00:21,280 -> 00:00:29,839] building setups. And he also has some inter experience in BCG. So, and later after he chose to not to
[00:00:29,839 -> 00:00:34,640] do consulting anymore and to switch to Amazon and right now
[00:00:34,640 -> 00:00:40,399] he's a senior data scientist on Facebook. So I feel is, you
[00:00:40,399 -> 00:00:44,399] know, he has this is his name is being tied with so many big
[00:00:44,399 -> 00:00:47,679] names of this, you of these great companies.
[00:00:47,679 -> 00:00:55,079] And especially during our personal interaction, I also know Yu Zheng had also wanted to stay
[00:00:55,079 -> 00:01:07,680] in academia, but later he made a transition and go to a non-academia world so i'm really excited to be able to uh have him as our uh second
[00:01:08,239 -> 00:01:17,040] the speaker of our second episode and i i think you will also learn a lot uh especially at this
[00:01:17,040 -> 00:01:23,920] stage of your phd you probably you are having some uh you know you probably want to stay in
[00:01:23,920 -> 00:01:28,400] academia and you also want to uh explore the world. And you also want to explore the world outside. And I
[00:01:28,400 -> 00:01:32,400] think you will benefit a lot from today's talk. So be her
[00:01:32,439 -> 00:01:33,719] introduced the rules.
[00:01:33,719 -> 00:01:37,079] Yeah, just a couple of housekeeping rules before we
[00:01:37,079 -> 00:01:41,200] start. So we would appreciate it if you meet yourself during the
[00:01:41,200 -> 00:01:49,000] talk to eliminate background noise, but you know, feel free to open your camera if you want. And then at
[00:01:49,000 -> 00:01:52,799] the end of the talk, we'll leave a lot of time for q&a, which I
[00:01:52,799 -> 00:01:56,439] think is going to be very, the most the more interesting part
[00:01:56,439 -> 00:02:00,079] where you can actually directly ask each and any questions. If
[00:02:00,079 -> 00:02:08,000] you want to ask directly, then just type raise hand in the chat box and then we will give the mic to you.
[00:02:08,000 -> 00:02:14,000] If you're a bit shy, you can type in the questions in the chat box and then one of us will read it out loud.
[00:02:14,000 -> 00:02:25,199] Please don't ask too many questions, maybe not more than two, but definitely encourage everyone to at least ask one question. I think, oh,
[00:02:25,199 -> 00:02:28,599] last thing, when you're asking questions, it'd be great to turn
[00:02:29,080 -> 00:02:32,599] on your video because it just always feels more personal to
[00:02:32,599 -> 00:02:36,759] see the person face to face. So that's pretty much everything.
[00:02:36,759 -> 00:02:39,000] Should we give the floor to our speaker?
[00:02:39,520 -> 00:02:44,560] Definitely. So I just stopped sharing. Yijun, can you start
[00:02:44,560 -> 00:02:44,919] sharing?
[00:02:44,800 -> 00:02:46,280] So I just stopped sharing. You john, can you start sharing?
[00:02:46,759 -> 00:02:49,039] Hey.
[00:02:52,759 -> 00:02:52,800] Yeah, so thank you for inviting us. Thank you for having this
[00:02:56,879 -> 00:02:56,919] series. I'm going to talk about that in my presentation as well
[00:03:00,199 -> 00:03:09,240] because that is one of the biggest lessons learned I learned as well. Like, looking back to my PhD years that I didn't spend much time knowing what's out there. So
[00:03:09,280 -> 00:03:14,599] just stayed on my epidemiopaths for too long. And that is one of
[00:03:14,599 -> 00:03:18,879] my biggest regrets of my of my life. Otherwise, I'll be much
[00:03:18,879 -> 00:03:25,599] richer than what I am right now. Okay, so thank you. And one more thing.
[00:03:25,639 -> 00:03:29,919] Sometimes I do not control the pace of my pace of my speak
[00:03:30,020 -> 00:03:36,439] well. And if you find something unclear, feel free to interrupt
[00:03:36,439 -> 00:03:41,120] me and ask me to repeat what do I actually mean. All right,
[00:03:52,360 -> 00:03:52,400] Alright, I'll start sharing. Okay, so from econ PhD to tech,
[00:03:57,479 -> 00:03:57,520] I guess the first part is going to be a brief introduction of my
[00:04:02,840 -> 00:04:05,879] journey. And the second is my lessons and kind of my three devices. So self intro,
[00:04:05,879 -> 00:04:09,520] this is just a screenshot of my thinking. Right now I'm a senior
[00:04:09,520 -> 00:04:14,360] data scientist on Facebook, I do Facebook e commerce, not the
[00:04:14,360 -> 00:04:19,759] Facebook shops, the marketplace citizenship. So if you I guess
[00:04:19,759 -> 00:04:23,560] most of us are from China is kind of saying you in the
[00:04:23,560 -> 00:04:30,319] American version. And before that, I was an economist at Amazon. So we do
[00:04:30,399 -> 00:04:34,399] so that Okay, so the difference between these two jobs at Amazon
[00:04:34,399 -> 00:04:39,399] as an economist, I got to do a lot of what I do in PhD. So I
[00:04:39,399 -> 00:04:43,240] read academic papers, I do models, I read machine learning
[00:04:43,240 -> 00:04:49,160] causal inference models. But as a data scientist at Facebook, I mostly
[00:04:49,160 -> 00:04:55,720] just do SQL to get data, and then taproot to plot two charts,
[00:04:55,759 -> 00:05:00,160] basically, I just pop our charts. And then I do kind of
[00:05:00,199 -> 00:05:05,040] analytics. So I tell people what does the data mean, and how
[00:05:05,040 -> 00:05:09,920] does that drives our decisions. So I'm basically using, I guess
[00:05:09,920 -> 00:05:13,360] second year statistical information I'm not doing
[00:05:13,360 -> 00:05:18,040] anything that is related to my PhD education. And I'm actually
[00:05:18,040 -> 00:05:22,319] pretty happy about my current job. And I'll talk later about
[00:05:22,560 -> 00:05:25,879] past dependent, and you wish we don't
[00:05:25,879 -> 00:05:30,079] need to just use what we learned we should unconstrained
[00:05:30,079 -> 00:05:33,720] optimization, but let's save that talk later. And before
[00:05:33,720 -> 00:05:39,920] that, it was Cornell PhD in economics, and it's six years.
[00:05:40,199 -> 00:05:44,480] And I hope this stays as four years that I would have much
[00:05:44,480 -> 00:05:46,939] better much more experience
[00:05:46,939 -> 00:05:49,839] and join the tech companies much earlier.
[00:05:49,839 -> 00:05:52,379] But okay, on the right is my dissertation.
[00:05:52,379 -> 00:05:55,199] So the dissertation is about firms,
[00:05:55,199 -> 00:05:57,060] investors and stock markets.
[00:05:58,879 -> 00:06:03,879] My job market paper is the real impact of IPO.
[00:06:04,959 -> 00:06:06,360] So using some natural
[00:06:06,360 -> 00:06:10,399] shock happening in China to understand the real impact of
[00:06:10,399 -> 00:06:18,959] IPO on like the impact of IPO on real economy. But now, when I
[00:06:18,959 -> 00:06:22,720] look back into my dissertation, I don't even care about what
[00:06:22,720 -> 00:06:29,439] conclusion I drew because it has no impact on the real world. Okay. And before
[00:06:29,439 -> 00:06:37,120] I graduate, so I graduated in August 2017. And before I
[00:06:37,120 -> 00:06:41,480] graduate, I spent three months as a summer consultant at BCG
[00:06:41,519 -> 00:06:49,839] in business office. I liked the experience a lot, but for some personal reasons, I chose to come back to the
[00:06:49,839 -> 00:06:56,959] States and do being tech. And during my PhD, so these are
[00:06:56,959 -> 00:07:04,360] during my PhD, I had some very strange, I guess, abnormal or
[00:07:06,379 -> 00:07:08,740] strange, I guess, abnormal or not normal experiences as a PhD student.
[00:07:08,740 -> 00:07:12,160] We founded a ramen shop in New York City.
[00:07:12,160 -> 00:07:16,800] And we did some, I guess, college grocery delivery
[00:07:16,800 -> 00:07:18,120] business at Cornell.
[00:07:18,120 -> 00:07:21,560] So it's almost like Amazon Fresh.
[00:07:21,560 -> 00:07:25,160] We ran weekly delivery from New York City to
[00:07:25,160 -> 00:07:29,040] Cornell campuses and deliver to student dorms. So definitely
[00:07:29,040 -> 00:07:33,639] raise that eyebrow. These are some screenshots. This is the
[00:07:33,680 -> 00:07:40,319] ramen shop. And we did a holiday market by a Korean town. That
[00:07:40,319 -> 00:07:48,079] was like we go there every morning and the market starts at 11 I think then we do we just
[00:07:48,639 -> 00:07:58,480] make Japanese ramen and we close at I forgot maybe 9 p.m and then we wash the pots the dishes and do
[00:07:58,480 -> 00:08:08,199] it all over again the next day not not me so but I helped. And this is the picture for the college grocery.
[00:08:08,199 -> 00:08:12,639] So we made posters, we collaborate with New York City
[00:08:12,639 -> 00:08:15,120] Chinese grocery store and we deliver other stuff
[00:08:15,120 -> 00:08:16,680] to campuses.
[00:08:16,680 -> 00:08:20,439] So this is you, you get an order on our website,
[00:08:20,439 -> 00:08:24,759] we get our stuff in New York City and we deliver it to you.
[00:08:24,759 -> 00:08:25,000] And this is kind of our delivery. We get our stuff in New York City and we deliver to you.
[00:08:25,000 -> 00:08:27,560] And this is kind of our delivery.
[00:08:27,560 -> 00:08:34,200] So this car goes from New York City to Ithaca and in boxes.
[00:08:34,200 -> 00:08:38,879] So the hierarchical shares at New York City puts the stuff into boxes and then we sort
[00:08:38,879 -> 00:08:40,279] into individual orders.
[00:08:40,279 -> 00:08:45,799] We had to do this because we didn't have a big enough car from New York City to Ithaca.
[00:08:48,039 -> 00:08:52,759] All right, so all those experiences, right?
[00:08:53,919 -> 00:08:56,799] What is my biggest lesson?
[00:08:56,799 -> 00:08:59,720] The biggest lesson is I enjoy my life much better
[00:08:59,720 -> 00:09:03,399] than after PhD than I was during PhD.
[00:09:03,399 -> 00:09:06,720] So during PhD PhD I also lived
[00:09:06,720 -> 00:09:10,399] up. I don't know like I like to explore, I like to do different
[00:09:10,399 -> 00:09:15,559] things. But when I had this constant fear of failing that
[00:09:15,559 -> 00:09:19,960] what if I don't get my PhD, what if I fail at academia, my peers
[00:09:19,960 -> 00:09:23,759] are studying and doing research, and they're so much smarter than
[00:09:23,759 -> 00:09:27,639] me. What I'm doing, you know, enjoying my life. So
[00:09:27,639 -> 00:09:33,240] I like if I go out and just have some fun, I would have a lot of
[00:09:33,360 -> 00:09:38,519] self guilt. And that is not a very pleasant feeling. If you
[00:09:38,559 -> 00:09:47,279] want you are you anxiety and fear, I guess. So after PhD, because I sell my
[00:09:47,279 -> 00:09:51,600] time to the company, I get to separate work versus life, no
[00:09:51,600 -> 00:09:55,360] matter how much or hours I put in my work, I get to enjoy my
[00:09:55,360 -> 00:10:02,519] own life. So an anecdote story is in PCG Beijing, the hours
[00:10:02,519 -> 00:10:09,559] were quite crazy. So I had to work 9 a.m. to about average 2 a.m.
[00:10:10,539 -> 00:10:13,759] Sometimes I go home at 12 and I feel like
[00:10:13,759 -> 00:10:18,759] today is a very lucky day because I get to go home 12 a.m.
[00:10:19,179 -> 00:10:22,000] And sometimes you have to go home at 5 a.m.
[00:10:22,000 -> 00:10:23,519] and wake up the next day,
[00:10:23,519 -> 00:10:25,360] wake up the same day, wake up the same day,
[00:10:30,440 -> 00:10:31,159] sleeping like three hours, but I still felt better than my PhD.
[00:10:33,879 -> 00:10:38,000] That was during my PhD time, like that was before my graduation, I still feel better doing the consulting work with
[00:10:38,000 -> 00:10:43,159] such a long hour than what I experienced during PhD because I
[00:10:43,159 -> 00:10:50,679] get to separate work and life. So and I get to quite like be myself basically, after
[00:10:50,679 -> 00:10:54,600] work, and that felt very good. And the last thing to mention is
[00:10:54,639 -> 00:10:59,200] living expenses, you get to earn much more after PhD. So that's a
[00:10:59,200 -> 00:11:05,000] big bonus. And this is kind of my Instagram story archive.
[00:11:06,679 -> 00:11:07,519] I just,
[00:11:11,600 -> 00:11:14,580] so not happening since I graduated from PhD.
[00:11:18,720 -> 00:11:19,559] Yeah.
[00:11:22,000 -> 00:11:23,779] I got to do things.
[00:11:23,779 -> 00:11:30,000] Yeah, that's lesson number one. And if I could do my PhD all over again, what would I do? So first, I didn't have this theory.
[00:11:30,000 -> 00:11:34,000] I didn't have this world beyond academia, certainly, when I was
[00:11:34,000 -> 00:11:39,000] in PhD, if I had that maybe I can realize much sooner that
[00:11:39,000 -> 00:11:43,000] academia is not what I want to do. So the first thing I want to
[00:11:43,000 -> 00:11:48,879] do is admit that I don't want to do is admit that I don't want to
[00:11:48,879 -> 00:11:53,080] do academia in my second year instead of my sixth year. I
[00:11:53,080 -> 00:11:58,919] stayed in PhD for six years, because I always think that, you
[00:11:58,919 -> 00:12:03,720] know, the best people in my best peers that are doing academia.
[00:12:04,080 -> 00:12:05,279] And that is
[00:12:05,279 -> 00:12:10,320] how the how PhD is supposed to do how we are supposed to do
[00:12:10,799 -> 00:12:15,720] academia. So I came here to do academia, I should do academia.
[00:12:16,039 -> 00:12:19,279] If I feel like I don't want to do academia, that is just
[00:12:19,279 -> 00:12:25,279] because things things are getting too hard. So I'm quitting. I equate
[00:12:26,720 -> 00:12:32,240] not interested in academia as funding excuse for quitting. So
[00:12:32,240 -> 00:12:37,960] I just stayed for too long. If I realize I don't like if I
[00:12:37,960 -> 00:12:41,919] realized that I honestly do not want to do PhD, I would have
[00:12:41,919 -> 00:12:44,799] told my committee that I don't want to do academia as soon as I
[00:12:44,799 -> 00:12:46,799] found that. And then I'll start
[00:12:46,799 -> 00:12:50,120] looking for industry internships. So I didn't do any
[00:12:50,120 -> 00:12:55,639] industry internships during my PhD. So the BCG is my first kind
[00:12:55,639 -> 00:12:59,879] of internship experience during my PhD, I would have done in
[00:12:59,899 -> 00:13:03,879] industry internships. And that would prepare me for much better
[00:13:03,960 -> 00:13:05,480] industry internships, and that would prepare me for much better
[00:13:12,039 -> 00:13:15,159] position or situation when I was looking for industry jobs, that I would have finished my PhD in four years instead of six,
[00:13:15,399 -> 00:13:19,120] because I don't think there was any extra value for me off of
[00:13:19,120 -> 00:13:26,399] the society by me staying in my PhD program for six years. And one thing I'm not
[00:13:26,399 -> 00:13:29,879] sure if it's achievable, but maybe if I realize I don't want
[00:13:29,879 -> 00:13:33,600] to do academia, that is during my PhD, I should have separated
[00:13:33,600 -> 00:13:37,440] my work from my life. I should have just had work hours and
[00:13:37,480 -> 00:13:42,320] nothing about the research and the other stuff I do after the
[00:13:42,320 -> 00:13:48,639] work hours. Because when I think back, I have self guilt.
[00:13:49,159 -> 00:13:52,019] I feel guilty not working.
[00:13:52,019 -> 00:13:55,240] So I constantly think about my work,
[00:13:55,240 -> 00:13:57,879] but it didn't help my productivity.
[00:13:57,879 -> 00:14:01,200] I feel like looking back, if I separated my work
[00:14:01,200 -> 00:14:03,879] and the life, I could be more productive in work
[00:14:03,879 -> 00:14:08,759] and much happier in life. So that is another lesson.
[00:14:11,039 -> 00:14:16,840] Alright, so three advices after having this lesson and spending
[00:14:16,840 -> 00:14:20,480] a couple years after academia. Advice number two is know
[00:14:20,480 -> 00:14:25,279] yourself, because I didn't. and I wasn't completely honest
[00:14:25,279 -> 00:14:32,519] with myself. And I think it's a very easy bias, like, like not
[00:14:32,519 -> 00:14:36,320] knowing yourself is common knowing yourself is difficult.
[00:14:36,919 -> 00:14:40,399] So know what is your true interest and your strengths,
[00:14:40,600 -> 00:14:44,000] like we are all good at studying well good at reading papers,
[00:14:44,039 -> 00:14:47,000] good at doing research. That's why we are here.
[00:14:47,000 -> 00:14:56,000] But beyond that, what is our strengths? And most importantly, what actually drives you? Like, do you feel excited doing research?
[00:14:56,000 -> 00:15:07,559] So I was, okay, so this part, the reason, part of the reason I stayed in academia for a long is I was actually very interested in research. I was in empirical
[00:15:07,559 -> 00:15:11,940] cover finance, and actually found the papers are
[00:15:11,940 -> 00:15:16,259] interesting. And I enjoy reading papers and I enjoy doing
[00:15:16,259 -> 00:15:23,700] research. But even even with that, I still feel like I do not
[00:15:23,700 -> 00:15:25,519] want to do academia because what
[00:15:25,519 -> 00:15:31,840] actually drives me is having an impact on the world. I don't
[00:15:31,840 -> 00:15:37,039] feel like I was doing that. By doing research, like the paper
[00:15:37,039 -> 00:15:42,559] I write, I don't think it's it can actually create the impact I
[00:15:42,559 -> 00:15:51,000] wanted to I want to I want for myself. Yeah, so understanding your underlying motivation is
[00:15:51,000 -> 00:15:55,639] very important. And then have a come, like, be honest about what
[00:15:55,639 -> 00:16:00,600] are your resources, what you can do. And sometimes knowing this
[00:16:00,799 -> 00:16:03,679] takes trying, like you don't know what you don't know, right.
[00:16:03,919 -> 00:16:07,980] So you had to try. Like, in fact, they have to
[00:16:07,980 -> 00:16:11,240] build this a minimal, minimal valuable products to validate
[00:16:11,240 -> 00:16:15,419] your assumptions. Sometimes it doesn't take much, for example,
[00:16:15,419 -> 00:16:21,340] coming to this series and listen to was beyond academia is a way
[00:16:21,360 -> 00:16:27,039] of knowing. Doing internships is a great way to try,
[00:16:27,039 -> 00:16:29,759] if you like, to really get to know the day-to-day
[00:16:29,759 -> 00:16:31,519] of different jobs,
[00:16:31,519 -> 00:16:36,440] and really understand if that is what you want to do, right?
[00:16:36,440 -> 00:16:38,720] And also, when you try,
[00:16:38,720 -> 00:16:41,120] now there are a lot of two-way door decisions,
[00:16:41,120 -> 00:16:43,639] especially when you are in PhD.
[00:16:43,639 -> 00:16:48,120] So for example, if you do an internship in industry, if you don't like
[00:16:48,120 -> 00:16:52,299] it, you can still come back, you can still do academia. So a lot
[00:16:52,299 -> 00:16:55,759] of decisions are two way door, that means you can just try and
[00:16:55,759 -> 00:17:00,799] come back, there is no, not much harm for trying. So definitely
[00:17:00,840 -> 00:17:07,519] take those opportunities. And try like the industry, the industry internship or the industry
[00:17:07,519 -> 00:17:11,599] experiences, if even if you decide to do academia, will be
[00:17:11,599 -> 00:17:15,759] good for your research and for academic job because you know,
[00:17:15,799 -> 00:17:18,720] like, for example, what kind of data is out there, what people
[00:17:18,720 -> 00:17:21,920] actually care about, and maybe you build some connections,
[00:17:21,960 -> 00:17:27,119] maybe like the like having multiple dimensional of experiences is going to help
[00:17:27,119 -> 00:17:32,319] you not going to hurt you. Otherwise, number two is
[00:17:32,359 -> 00:17:35,599] unconstrained optimization is always better than constraint
[00:17:35,599 -> 00:17:40,200] on maybe a bigger equal to bigger than equal to, but it's
[00:17:40,359 -> 00:17:43,480] like most of the case is better, right? Sometimes it's equal.
[00:17:44,240 -> 00:17:49,000] Sometimes we stuck in academia for too long. And that is, I guess, echoes because earlier point
[00:17:49,319 -> 00:17:52,640] that a lot of people stay in academia because one they don't
[00:17:52,640 -> 00:17:57,920] know what they can do outside of academia. And to. They want to
[00:17:57,920 -> 00:18:01,759] use the dispense so much time in academia, they spend so much
[00:18:01,759 -> 00:18:07,920] time in research, they want to use that they want to play that
[00:18:07,920 -> 00:18:13,200] strength. And they don't want to just give it up. But that is, I
[00:18:13,200 -> 00:18:17,400] guess, a bias itself. Like, just think about what makes you happy
[00:18:17,400 -> 00:18:22,759] tomorrow, or in 10 years or in 20 years of our life. It's not
[00:18:22,759 -> 00:18:25,960] going to be like, a lot of cases, it's not going to be like, a lot of cases is
[00:18:25,960 -> 00:18:30,079] not going to be just, you know, repeating what you did for the
[00:18:30,079 -> 00:18:35,039] past 10 years. If today there are two choices, option number
[00:18:35,039 -> 00:18:39,839] one leads to a better life in 10 years or even in one year,
[00:18:40,039 -> 00:18:43,799] option number two is doing what you have been doing or what you
[00:18:43,799 -> 00:18:45,960] are good at. but you are going
[00:18:45,960 -> 00:18:47,680] to be less happy in one year.
[00:18:47,680 -> 00:18:48,799] Choose option number one.
[00:18:48,799 -> 00:18:51,480] Don't choose option number two just
[00:18:51,480 -> 00:18:56,039] because you did option number two for such a long time.
[00:18:56,039 -> 00:18:58,119] So do unconstrained optimization.
[00:18:58,119 -> 00:19:01,359] Don't let your past constrain you.
[00:19:01,359 -> 00:19:07,200] So past dependent, sunk cost, loss a version, those are things that stop you from
[00:19:07,200 -> 00:19:14,079] trying new things. And I talked about this earlier, like, really be honest about yourself,
[00:19:14,079 -> 00:19:25,440] not only like admitting your strengths and your shortcomings, but also, you know, sometimes it's okay to quit and know that it's okay to
[00:19:25,440 -> 00:19:31,880] quit. I was I guess, for me, it was my ego and pride, or like
[00:19:31,900 -> 00:19:37,900] myself, discipline, that got into my way of admitting I'm not
[00:19:37,940 -> 00:19:42,420] interested in academia. So it goes both ways, right? So really
[00:19:42,420 -> 00:19:45,319] be completely honest with yourself.
[00:19:45,319 -> 00:19:49,920] And the cost, the second part is,
[00:19:49,920 -> 00:19:53,279] the cost, a lot of times, the cost of not acting
[00:19:53,279 -> 00:19:55,799] is bigger than the risk of acting.
[00:19:55,799 -> 00:19:59,960] And PhD, the program definitely gives you a shelter,
[00:19:59,960 -> 00:20:01,599] an excuse to not act.
[00:20:01,599 -> 00:20:02,859] What do I mean by this?
[00:20:03,799 -> 00:20:08,000] If you are a PhD
[00:20:12,079 -> 00:20:18,079] in Western schools, right, it's five years program, it is, it is a very long time. And, and the program doesn't ask you much
[00:20:18,079 -> 00:20:22,599] results until the end, because they want to give you some
[00:20:22,599 -> 00:20:25,000] freedom to, to really
[00:20:25,000 -> 00:20:30,680] focus and do research without the worry that, you know, next
[00:20:30,680 -> 00:20:33,519] week, I will tell you how to do next month, what I have to do,
[00:20:33,799 -> 00:20:38,559] to give you some stipends, and they give you a very limited
[00:20:38,599 -> 00:20:41,960] environment. And to tell you, you know, just focus on
[00:20:41,960 -> 00:20:46,200] research. So it's a shelter to not try in different things
[00:20:46,200 -> 00:20:49,039] because for example, for me,
[00:20:49,039 -> 00:20:51,880] before every summer I stayed at Cornell
[00:20:51,880 -> 00:20:54,839] and did extra research.
[00:20:54,839 -> 00:20:59,839] You're apply for a summer RA or TA,
[00:21:00,440 -> 00:21:03,200] and then I stay at school and I go to library every day
[00:21:03,200 -> 00:21:06,640] to do research instead of applying for an internship.
[00:21:06,640 -> 00:21:09,220] And I felt pretty good about my decision
[00:21:09,220 -> 00:21:11,900] because I was focusing on research.
[00:21:11,900 -> 00:21:15,400] I didn't waste any of my time.
[00:21:15,400 -> 00:21:20,400] But now if you ask me, what did I do summer of,
[00:21:20,740 -> 00:21:23,960] I don't know, 2015, I don't remember.
[00:21:23,960 -> 00:21:28,119] I don't remember what paper I read. I don't remember what research I did. I feel like
[00:21:28,200 -> 00:21:32,079] it's a complete, it's not complete waste of time, but it
[00:21:32,079 -> 00:21:38,440] is a waste of time. So that was the cost of me not having not
[00:21:38,480 -> 00:21:44,960] acting to apply for summer internship. And I guess that's
[00:21:44,960 -> 00:21:46,839] an easy trap for a lot of
[00:21:46,839 -> 00:21:51,599] PhD because the program is set up this way. So think about what
[00:21:51,599 -> 00:21:56,400] is the cost of you not acting? And what is the risk if you
[00:21:56,400 -> 00:22:00,519] actually act? A lot of the time the risk of acting is very
[00:22:00,519 -> 00:22:08,599] small, you actually benefit from acting and the cost of not acting is ignored. But the best number
[00:22:08,599 -> 00:22:12,720] three is no ready know what's out there. And this one I think
[00:22:12,720 -> 00:22:17,759] is, I guess, in terms of risk reward is definitely everyone
[00:22:17,759 -> 00:22:21,000] should just know, like, you know, you should know your
[00:22:21,000 -> 00:22:24,680] options beyond academia, right? So coming to this talk, again,
[00:22:23,500 -> 00:22:25,759] you should know your options beyond academia, right? So coming to this talk again, it's great.
[00:22:25,759 -> 00:22:30,200] Your options, what industries you can go.
[00:22:30,200 -> 00:22:33,779] Like I hear a lot of you either come from consulting
[00:22:33,779 -> 00:22:36,579] or come from, or want to do consulting.
[00:22:36,579 -> 00:22:38,359] Consulting is a great industry.
[00:22:38,359 -> 00:22:41,799] I, later on, I'll like post a screenshot
[00:22:41,799 -> 00:22:43,079] of my YouTube channel.
[00:22:50,759 -> 00:22:50,960] And I talked about the value of consulting that brings to the
[00:22:54,119 -> 00:22:59,400] to to the firm that hires consultants. I think it's a great industry. But beyond consulting, there are also a lot
[00:22:59,400 -> 00:23:04,720] of other industry that industries that just hire a PhD
[00:23:04,720 -> 00:23:05,279] because you are a PhD because
[00:23:05,279 -> 00:23:09,079] you are a PhD, for example, tech, hires all sorts of people
[00:23:09,480 -> 00:23:13,200] to solve their problems, whether it's data, whether it's
[00:23:13,240 -> 00:23:18,000] optimization, like some operation research. And
[00:23:18,039 -> 00:23:22,000] sometimes it's even like material science, mechanical
[00:23:22,000 -> 00:23:28,839] engineering, at this heart, all sorts of PhD. So no options, I guess, consulting and data, all the
[00:23:28,839 -> 00:23:37,200] PhDs can just get into and try. So no was really like, no,
[00:23:37,200 -> 00:23:42,200] average salary, no career paths. And what do they do day to day?
[00:23:42,200 -> 00:23:48,960] Yeah, really know what to do.. So then you can fairly assess, are you going to be interested in
[00:23:48,960 -> 00:23:53,440] this type of job or should I do something else. And also now
[00:23:53,440 -> 00:23:56,880] option if you choose to do something else. For example, if
[00:23:56,880 -> 00:24:02,880] you just take a computer science master, or if you go to go do
[00:24:02,880 -> 00:24:08,519] some internship, or if you prepare an interview for half a year,
[00:24:08,519 -> 00:24:12,119] or maybe you take some, I don't know,
[00:24:12,119 -> 00:24:14,279] machine learning courses,
[00:24:14,279 -> 00:24:16,599] and you build your resume that way.
[00:24:16,599 -> 00:24:21,059] It will open a lot of different options for you.
[00:24:21,059 -> 00:24:26,660] So now, based on your current capacity, and based on
[00:24:26,660 -> 00:24:32,420] what you can do in a year, no options and really do the
[00:24:32,420 -> 00:24:38,420] unconstrained optimization. And then the I guess, the last part
[00:24:38,420 -> 00:24:43,660] is chance of success. And that leads to my next slide, how to
[00:24:43,660 -> 00:24:45,519] increase our chance of success
[00:24:45,519 -> 00:24:49,660] of getting what you want to, what you try to get.
[00:24:49,660 -> 00:24:53,000] So find the gap between what you want to do.
[00:24:53,000 -> 00:24:55,640] The first is know what you want to do, right?
[00:24:55,640 -> 00:24:57,359] And know other industries,
[00:24:57,359 -> 00:25:00,500] know what career you want to choose.
[00:25:00,500 -> 00:25:02,480] For example, a lot of you want to do consulting,
[00:25:02,480 -> 00:25:03,400] that's great.
[00:25:03,400 -> 00:25:09,000] Then what is the gap between your current resume, between current knowledge, experiences, projects,
[00:25:09,000 -> 00:25:14,000] do you have the right internships to get to consulting?
[00:25:14,000 -> 00:25:17,000] Are they going to take your resume and give you an interview?
[00:25:17,000 -> 00:25:19,000] And then you need to prepare for interviews, right?
[00:25:19,000 -> 00:25:26,519] And sometimes building connections can give you either recommendations, referral, or just
[00:25:26,519 -> 00:25:35,400] give you some knowledge and, you know, tell you what's the most effective way to prepare
[00:25:35,400 -> 00:25:38,380] for interview or to bridge our gap.
[00:25:38,380 -> 00:25:51,160] So this is, I guess, an action item. Know what's out there. Have access, like a fair, honest access of yourself.
[00:25:51,160 -> 00:25:55,720] And then start acting to close the gap.
[00:25:55,720 -> 00:25:58,119] I have a YouTube video about data science, what
[00:25:58,119 -> 00:26:00,200] data scientists do.
[00:26:00,200 -> 00:26:03,279] And today, I'm going to meet with a friend
[00:26:03,279 -> 00:26:11,200] and shoot another video to talk about how to close the gap to get into data science.
[00:26:11,400 -> 00:26:16,200] So what companies are looking for and how do you prepare,
[00:26:16,200 -> 00:26:20,000] what materials do you need to do to prepare for, to close the gap.
[00:26:20,200 -> 00:26:22,599] So stay tuned and subscribe.
[00:26:23,799 -> 00:26:24,200] All right.
[00:26:24,400 -> 00:26:27,680] So this is a screenshot of my YouTube channel.
[00:26:27,680 -> 00:26:29,759] For example, talk about A-B testing,
[00:26:29,759 -> 00:26:33,680] talk about how AI is applied in big tech companies,
[00:26:33,680 -> 00:26:37,799] what is management consulting, and what is data science.
[00:26:37,799 -> 00:26:40,880] I have some Juhu articles, maybe in the future
[00:26:40,880 -> 00:26:44,720] about also making videos based on these articles.
[00:26:49,359 -> 00:26:53,640] But this one, for example, talks about how you prepare for mock interview. I guess, okay, a little bit about
[00:26:53,640 -> 00:26:58,240] myself. Maybe here. Yeah, it's all going to be okay. Yeah, a
[00:26:58,240 -> 00:27:02,599] little bit about myself in the end. So one, because you are a
[00:27:02,599 -> 00:27:07,359] PhD, you're all smart and diligent, otherwise you won't be able to get here.
[00:27:07,359 -> 00:27:09,920] People, a lot of people, like a lot of us
[00:27:09,920 -> 00:27:13,319] have imposer syndrome that, you know,
[00:27:13,319 -> 00:27:17,440] we got here because of lack or because,
[00:27:17,440 -> 00:27:20,440] but everyone, all my peers are smarter than me,
[00:27:20,440 -> 00:27:23,720] so I must be the imposer, I must be faking it.
[00:27:23,720 -> 00:27:26,400] No, you deserve the PhD,
[00:27:27,039 -> 00:27:31,599] you're smart and intelligent. And you actually have better resource than most people. I'm not
[00:27:31,599 -> 00:27:38,559] only talking about the advisors, your professors, the class you can take, you can take most classes
[00:27:38,559 -> 00:27:49,119] for free as a PhD. So take those classes, do the projects, build your resume. But also, even if you try to fake, if you want to,
[00:27:49,119 -> 00:27:58,359] for example, a lot of people in tech, AI is very easy to fake.
[00:27:58,359 -> 00:28:03,279] Not to fake, but very easy to get to know.
[00:28:03,279 -> 00:28:08,400] For example, machine learning is just basically
[00:28:08,400 -> 00:28:14,400] it takes takes a month or, or maybe three months to get to know
[00:28:14,400 -> 00:28:18,039] AI well, if you're ready to prepare for it. So if it takes
[00:28:18,079 -> 00:28:22,359] three months, and prepare, like learn about AI and then you take
[00:28:22,359 -> 00:28:27,359] another three months write a paper about AI. Maybe it's not, it's useful,
[00:28:27,359 -> 00:28:31,240] maybe it's not. But HR because our PhD will pay attention to
[00:28:31,240 -> 00:28:36,400] you. And it's what adds, it's what boosts our resume and give
[00:28:36,400 -> 00:28:39,680] you a chance to most tech companies. So that is the
[00:28:39,680 -> 00:28:44,440] resource that many people do not have. Then you can maximize
[00:28:44,440 -> 00:28:45,839] your experience on one dimension.
[00:28:45,839 -> 00:28:48,619] You maximize the experience on one dimension.
[00:28:49,759 -> 00:28:54,559] So I, when I was doing consulting, I was back in Beijing
[00:28:54,559 -> 00:28:59,559] and my, I guess my peers, people who are at my same age,
[00:29:00,319 -> 00:29:03,140] I had with people who do startups
[00:29:03,140 -> 00:29:07,039] and a lot of them were quite successful.
[00:29:07,039 -> 00:29:13,440] They started companies that have well-known names, and they had, like, if they went to
[00:29:13,440 -> 00:29:16,440] industry, some of them are directors.
[00:29:16,440 -> 00:29:18,640] They were quite successful.
[00:29:18,640 -> 00:29:24,480] But I feel like I didn't waste my time doing PhD because I met, I also, like, because I
[00:29:24,480 -> 00:29:28,400] had title of PhD, I maximize my experience out of academia.
[00:29:28,759 -> 00:29:34,799] And so pH doing doing PhD in academia is really like playing
[00:29:34,799 -> 00:29:38,799] at a very high level, right? And not many people get to see that.
[00:29:38,880 -> 00:29:43,039] So if you draw an analogy in sports, it's almost like playing
[00:29:43,039 -> 00:29:48,000] a youth team for football club, right? You got to the top level, you know, what
[00:29:48,039 -> 00:29:51,799] the top level looks like. Or like if you're funded, a
[00:29:51,839 -> 00:29:55,000] mildly successful successful startup, if you're like, you
[00:29:55,000 -> 00:29:59,039] don't know what, what does it take to be a to be a true,
[00:29:59,240 -> 00:30:03,480] truly successful startup. But you like you interact with the
[00:30:03,480 -> 00:30:08,799] best scholars in the world. And you have this title that stays with you for a whole life
[00:30:08,839 -> 00:30:13,119] that says, you know, you are a PhD, you complete a great deal
[00:30:13,160 -> 00:30:17,440] in academia, and you are one of the smartest people in the
[00:30:17,440 -> 00:30:22,680] world. So that's great. It's all going to be okay. I want to, oh,
[00:30:22,759 -> 00:30:31,359] one last thing about myself. Yeah. I wasted and not wasted. I spent six years in
[00:30:31,680 -> 00:30:37,599] optimia, and only to realize, on my sixth year, but I don't
[00:30:37,599 -> 00:30:48,799] really want to do optimia. So I applied the BCG, going back to my resume, I applied the BCG job, I think December 2016
[00:30:54,240 -> 00:30:58,519] and got the internship January 2017,
[00:30:58,519 -> 00:31:02,799] sorry, got the interview January 2017.
[00:31:02,799 -> 00:31:07,559] I prepared a week for my mock interviews and got
[00:31:07,559 -> 00:31:13,200] the internship and got in. So one is I had article about how
[00:31:13,200 -> 00:31:16,640] to prepare mock interviews, how to prepare the interviews
[00:31:16,640 -> 00:31:22,039] efficiently. But two, I feel like that's a lucky shot. And
[00:31:22,039 -> 00:31:26,279] then at Amazon, like I didn't apply to any tech
[00:31:26,279 -> 00:31:30,880] jobs. Amazon is the only one applied, I got the interview and
[00:31:30,920 -> 00:31:35,519] I got him. And later I discovered that is kind of one
[00:31:35,519 -> 00:31:43,160] of the best jobs that I can, I can ever have. So a lot of this
[00:31:43,160 -> 00:31:47,759] is luck. But I don't think it's purely luck. It's also because
[00:31:47,759 -> 00:31:56,000] I have the title, I had some experiences during PhD, and I spent the time and ready to prepare
[00:31:56,000 -> 00:32:07,000] for the interview. So there are a lot of things you can do much better than I did by starting early. So that was all my advice and lessons.
[00:32:07,000 -> 00:32:10,220] If I knew this in my second year,
[00:32:10,220 -> 00:32:13,680] I would prepare myself so well that I couldn't fail.
[00:32:13,680 -> 00:32:17,440] So yeah, that is my lessons and advices.
[00:32:17,440 -> 00:32:18,880] Thank you for listening.
[00:32:22,599 -> 00:32:24,640] Thank you, Yujun, that's very helpful.
[00:32:24,640 -> 00:32:28,400] And I think, you know, what's really impressive
[00:32:28,400 -> 00:32:33,539] is how genuine you are in sharing your thoughts and experience. And it's really encouraging
[00:32:33,539 -> 00:32:39,559] to people who are who might be having second doubts about themselves. You know, before
[00:32:39,559 -> 00:32:45,240] people in the audience, feel free to ask questions or type in your questions.
[00:32:45,240 -> 00:32:47,400] But we've had a couple coming in.
[00:32:47,400 -> 00:32:50,519] And I feel like because your experience is so broad,
[00:32:50,519 -> 00:32:54,400] people might ask all sorts of questions.
[00:32:54,400 -> 00:32:57,440] And it could be loosely categorized
[00:32:57,440 -> 00:33:00,640] into your experience as an economist,
[00:33:00,640 -> 00:33:04,599] and then having startups yourselves,
[00:33:04,599 -> 00:33:06,180] and then transitioning into a
[00:33:06,180 -> 00:33:11,279] data scientist and now you know having your own YouTube channel and then some
[00:33:11,279 -> 00:33:15,640] people might just want some general advice for you so let's try to maybe
[00:33:15,640 -> 00:33:26,000] group our questions in this kind of categories. Anyone wants to be the first person asking a question live?
[00:33:33,000 -> 00:33:35,000] Hello?
[00:33:35,000 -> 00:33:37,000] Hello?
[00:33:37,000 -> 00:33:45,000] Hi Fumi, we can hear you. So, would you advise to someone who is interested in going to the
[00:33:45,000 -> 00:33:47,000] industry later to
[00:33:48,000 -> 00:33:49,000] start
[00:33:49,000 -> 00:33:50,000] a
[00:33:50,000 -> 00:33:53,000] video sharing, because that's the rule we said for q&a if you
[00:33:53,000 -> 00:33:54,000] want to ask a question like
[00:33:56,000 -> 00:34:00,000] was the rule. Yeah, there's a rule for q&a if you want to ask
[00:34:00,000 -> 00:34:02,000] in person is better to just share a video.
[00:34:04,000 -> 00:34:05,319] Oh to turn on the video. Right. Yeah, there's a rule for Q&A. If you want to ask in person, it's better to just share
[00:34:05,319 -> 00:34:06,319] a video.
[00:34:06,319 -> 00:34:09,559] Oh, to turn on the video?
[00:34:09,559 -> 00:34:10,559] Right.
[00:34:10,559 -> 00:34:11,559] Oh,
[00:34:11,559 -> 00:34:12,559] unnecessary.
[00:34:12,559 -> 00:34:13,559] All right.
[00:34:13,559 -> 00:34:16,559] Sorry, I didn't prepare.
[00:34:16,559 -> 00:34:20,559] Okay. Yeah, feel free.
[00:34:20,559 -> 00:34:26,960] Okay. Would it be better to try to finish the PhD faster or
[00:34:26,960 -> 00:34:31,320] utilize the summer to do internships? And how would you
[00:34:31,320 -> 00:34:35,000] compare the problems in financial markets to consumer
[00:34:35,000 -> 00:34:37,639] markets? Two questions.
[00:34:38,239 -> 00:34:41,800] Yeah, the first one I think is easy, but I didn't get the
[00:34:41,800 -> 00:34:47,199] second one. So I'll ask for clarification. The first one, like, internship is ready
[00:34:47,199 -> 00:34:51,599] to try out right and build a resume. If you have a good
[00:34:51,599 -> 00:34:54,559] enough resume, and if you know what you need to do, then just
[00:34:54,559 -> 00:34:59,800] finish a PhD and do that. But if you don't, then definitely, you
[00:34:59,800 -> 00:35:04,440] know, try as many internships and until you, you have a good
[00:35:04,440 -> 00:35:05,000] enough resume
[00:35:05,480 -> 00:35:08,000] to do the things you know you want to do.
[00:35:09,099 -> 00:35:10,800] The second question, financial markets
[00:35:10,800 -> 00:35:12,039] and the consumer markets,
[00:35:13,679 -> 00:35:16,039] is it choosing between the industry or?
[00:35:17,679 -> 00:35:20,099] Are the problems similar or different?
[00:35:22,300 -> 00:35:23,340] The promise?
[00:35:47,239 -> 00:35:50,400] Are the problems similar or different. Oh, okay, I guess it's about how did I apply my knowledge of a finance PhD like economics concentrated in finance to consumer markets, right? A lot of tools and skills can be carried over. For example, I did apply econometrics.
[00:35:50,400 -> 00:35:55,400] I did causal inference for the corporate finance study.
[00:35:55,559 -> 00:35:58,480] For example, matching, difference in difference,
[00:35:58,480 -> 00:36:01,000] all those causal inference stuff.
[00:36:01,000 -> 00:36:04,280] And those tools can be directly applied
[00:36:04,280 -> 00:36:05,039] to solve
[00:36:05,320 -> 00:36:09,860] consumer markets problems. That's why Amazon hired me to
[00:36:09,860 -> 00:36:15,519] do or what they hired me to do. But again, going back to not
[00:36:15,519 -> 00:36:20,079] limiting myself, I guess I didn't. This reminds me I
[00:36:20,079 -> 00:36:22,599] didn't I promised to talk about the difference between data
[00:36:22,599 -> 00:36:29,079] scientists and economics and forgot to do that. Like, it
[00:36:29,079 -> 00:36:33,840] doesn't like, what drives me is to solve problems and create
[00:36:33,840 -> 00:36:37,800] impact. And it doesn't take complicated model to solve
[00:36:37,800 -> 00:36:42,679] problems. In a lot of cases, if the problem is worth stopping,
[00:36:43,079 -> 00:36:48,280] like comparing the two means or or you know, finding where the problem is, is much more
[00:36:48,280 -> 00:36:51,719] important than being able to build sophisticated models. Of
[00:36:51,719 -> 00:36:54,840] course, there are problems that needs to be solved by
[00:36:54,840 -> 00:37:00,119] sophisticated models. And I'm also like, mildly interested in
[00:37:00,119 -> 00:37:07,440] doing that. But that is not that is not how I
[00:37:07,440 -> 00:37:10,599] think about my career. When I think about my career is not
[00:37:10,599 -> 00:37:15,119] about how to apply my past knowledge. It's about what
[00:37:15,159 -> 00:37:21,719] problems excites me. So I guess to some to some, some of the
[00:37:21,719 -> 00:37:27,639] skills are transferable. But the domain knowledge, for example, is definitely not relevant. And
[00:37:28,639 -> 00:37:31,000] yeah, I don't feel sorry for that.
[00:37:38,440 -> 00:37:41,000] Right, thank you. Anyone else got a question?
[00:37:42,280 -> 00:37:43,800] Can everyone help me?
[00:37:44,760 -> 00:37:45,159] Yes. Anyone else got a question? Can everyone hear me?
[00:37:45,159 -> 00:37:46,440] Yes.
[00:37:46,440 -> 00:37:47,719] Hi, I'm Ma Chen.
[00:37:47,719 -> 00:37:50,239] I have one question about the stop.
[00:37:50,239 -> 00:37:55,559] So I'm curious what happened to your stop in the end?
[00:37:55,559 -> 00:37:58,639] Oh, we closed College Grocery when we took off,
[00:37:58,639 -> 00:38:01,599] because it's actually a very heavy operation.
[00:38:01,599 -> 00:38:03,280] It takes a lot of operations.
[00:38:03,280 -> 00:38:06,920] For example, you have to do customer service, you had to maintain a good
[00:38:06,920 -> 00:38:11,320] relationship with the grocery store. If you get one kind of
[00:38:11,880 -> 00:38:15,840] vinegar, but they're out of stock, do you replace or do you
[00:38:16,480 -> 00:38:21,079] refund? There are a lot of like tricky, like things that takes
[00:38:21,079 -> 00:38:31,599] time and nobody was willing to do that after I left so we're just gonna see and but I'm still operating in New York City I hope the pandemic didn't
[00:38:33,039 -> 00:38:37,440] didn't make them bankrupt but they had three I think
[00:38:40,480 -> 00:38:46,800] shops in New York City. Okay I see see. Yeah, so I have a second question
[00:38:46,800 -> 00:38:48,300] which is a little personal.
[00:38:48,300 -> 00:38:52,280] So what's the intensive when you decided to
[00:38:53,659 -> 00:38:55,320] like build up a startup?
[00:38:55,320 -> 00:38:58,840] Is it to try to make a lot of money
[00:38:58,840 -> 00:39:03,000] or like just a random decision to try different things?
[00:39:03,000 -> 00:39:04,920] Yeah, good question.
[00:39:04,920 -> 00:39:06,920] Because that's actually my motivation
[00:39:06,920 -> 00:39:08,400] for doing a lot of things, including
[00:39:08,400 -> 00:39:09,440] start a YouTube channel.
[00:39:09,440 -> 00:39:12,800] It's not, it's never about the money.
[00:39:12,800 -> 00:39:15,599] It's just about seeing a problem and I want to solve it.
[00:39:15,599 -> 00:39:18,880] And I have a huge, like a big drive to solve the problem.
[00:39:18,880 -> 00:39:23,000] The startup started because I go to New York City quite often.
[00:39:23,000 -> 00:39:25,079] And every time I go there, people ask me,
[00:39:25,079 -> 00:39:27,800] can you bring us some grocery bag?
[00:39:27,800 -> 00:39:32,480] I'm willing to pay you like 50% above the recipe,
[00:39:32,480 -> 00:39:35,760] like the price.
[00:39:35,760 -> 00:39:38,719] And I said, OK, there is a real demand.
[00:39:38,719 -> 00:39:40,000] Let's try to solve it.
[00:39:40,000 -> 00:39:42,639] And that's how I started.
[00:39:42,639 -> 00:39:45,039] We started with a Google form
[00:39:45,039 -> 00:39:46,960] and then turn into a Wix website
[00:39:46,960 -> 00:39:49,239] and then turn into a Shopify website.
[00:39:50,159 -> 00:39:52,920] In retrospect, it's actually helped
[00:39:52,920 -> 00:39:55,960] a lot of my current experiences
[00:39:55,960 -> 00:40:00,119] because Facebook is doing the Facebook shops with Shopify.
[00:40:00,119 -> 00:40:03,440] And my experiences of running a Shopify store
[00:40:03,440 -> 00:40:04,940] actually helped me understand
[00:40:04,940 -> 00:40:05,760] a lot of
[00:40:05,760 -> 00:40:12,239] e-commerce business in general, but that was never the plan. I see, thank you.
[00:40:16,079 -> 00:40:18,000] Yeah, may I ask one question?
[00:40:20,320 -> 00:40:27,679] Okay, thank you, Yujun. I'm also a PhD student in economics. So I know that Amazon has already
[00:40:27,679 -> 00:40:35,679] established the economics team, while Facebook is resting new in building its economics team.
[00:40:35,679 -> 00:40:40,800] So I'm curious that how do you feel about working in this two companies? Do you feel
[00:40:40,800 -> 00:40:45,760] more like familiar in Amazon environment compared to Facebook?
[00:40:47,440 -> 00:40:52,639] There are two very different companies, even though they are intact. Also, there is more
[00:40:52,639 -> 00:40:58,239] difference between Facebook and Amazon, and between Amazon and BCG even. And I don't think
[00:40:58,239 -> 00:41:05,679] Facebook is going to hire a lot of economists to do the economics economist because at Facebook, it provides
[00:41:05,679 -> 00:41:09,840] a free product. They can run a B testing for almost everything.
[00:41:10,199 -> 00:41:14,199] And Amazon hires economics mostly to do causal inference.
[00:41:14,920 -> 00:41:17,559] But Facebook can do a B testing. So don't they don't need to do
[00:41:17,559 -> 00:41:27,559] this. But my training of economics PhD helped me to I guess the training is helpful. I
[00:41:27,559 -> 00:41:30,599] also have a very short video about this. It forced me to
[00:41:30,599 -> 00:41:34,239] think about equilibrium, I think about marginal, and when you
[00:41:34,239 -> 00:41:38,159] solve problem at tech companies, you'll find a lot of people,
[00:41:38,320 -> 00:41:42,199] they focus on the first order effect of your policy. For
[00:41:42,199 -> 00:41:48,760] example, if you set a price for right, it will make people sell more expensive stuff. But they
[00:41:48,760 -> 00:41:51,519] didn't think about the substitution effect, or the
[00:41:51,519 -> 00:41:53,800] incoming factor, whatever they don't care about, they didn't
[00:41:53,800 -> 00:41:57,320] think about the second order problem. And a lot of the time,
[00:41:57,320 -> 00:42:02,800] the second, the second order impact is more important. So I
[00:42:02,800 -> 00:42:05,900] guess the training of economics PhD, if
[00:42:05,900 -> 00:42:09,380] you have the sufficient tech skill, like if you can write a
[00:42:09,380 -> 00:42:13,380] SQL well, if you can do analysis fast, if you can do data
[00:42:13,420 -> 00:42:17,760] manipulation in Python, then combined with our economics
[00:42:17,820 -> 00:42:25,000] degree is quite welcomed at any company, consulting or tech.
[00:42:26,800 -> 00:42:31,800] But yeah, like don't expect other tech companies
[00:42:33,820 -> 00:42:37,139] to hire economists as Amazon does.
[00:42:37,139 -> 00:42:38,659] Yeah.
[00:42:38,659 -> 00:42:39,820] Thank you.
[00:42:39,820 -> 00:42:42,460] I have a related question on that actually.
[00:42:43,619 -> 00:42:45,719] When I first joined McKinsey,
[00:42:45,719 -> 00:42:47,559] I actually spent three months working
[00:42:47,559 -> 00:42:49,360] on the data science project.
[00:42:49,360 -> 00:42:52,119] And my role was what they call a data translator.
[00:42:52,119 -> 00:42:57,039] So our project was around something that's got to do
[00:42:57,039 -> 00:42:59,559] with clinical and pharmaceutical applications
[00:42:59,559 -> 00:43:00,760] of data science.
[00:43:00,760 -> 00:43:03,239] And we had half of our team,
[00:43:03,239 -> 00:43:08,000] pure data scientists and data engineers, and the other half people with a medical
[00:43:08,000 -> 00:43:12,760] degree or a PhD in biological sciences. So I'm wondering that
[00:43:12,780 -> 00:43:16,559] you know, outside of maybe, you know, consulting related data
[00:43:16,559 -> 00:43:20,159] science projects in the real data science industry, is there
[00:43:20,159 -> 00:43:24,599] a need for this kind of roles of people who may not be coding,
[00:43:24,639 -> 00:43:28,119] but they know something about data science to translate the
[00:43:28,119 -> 00:43:32,639] business or clinical or consumer aspect of the industry.
[00:43:38,519 -> 00:43:46,360] Yes, but okay, so the, the world of consulting is pretty different
[00:43:46,360 -> 00:43:51,079] than a lot of tech. And related to a question in this way,
[00:43:51,800 -> 00:43:55,199] consulting deals with a lot of companies, right? They don't
[00:43:55,199 -> 00:43:59,639] necessarily have the expertise to understand those complex
[00:43:59,679 -> 00:44:05,639] analysis or complex research. So they need a translator. In tech,
[00:44:06,000 -> 00:44:10,960] everyone should know tech, like, they have a very high hiring
[00:44:10,960 -> 00:44:18,800] bar for BA engineers or product manager. So everyone knows their
[00:44:18,800 -> 00:44:23,400] shit, basically. They don't need a translator to translate
[00:44:23,440 -> 00:44:27,639] otherwise they will just fail at their job, because that's the expectation to know
[00:44:27,639 -> 00:44:34,840] their stuff. That being said, said, like, for example, people
[00:44:34,840 -> 00:44:39,440] in business function to don't necessarily that did not do not
[00:44:39,440 -> 00:44:43,960] necessarily well versed in, in models, for example, they
[00:44:43,960 -> 00:44:47,719] understand was the difference between correlation and
[00:44:47,719 -> 00:44:51,579] causation. They know to get this, you have to overcome
[00:44:51,579 -> 00:44:55,800] selection bias. They know, you know, on a very high level what
[00:44:55,800 -> 00:45:01,199] machine learning can do and cannot do. But sometimes if you
[00:45:01,199 -> 00:45:04,960] want to, for example, translate to a devised mean and like a
[00:45:04,960 -> 00:45:05,840] normal mean, how does, translate a devised mean and like a normal mean,
[00:45:05,840 -> 00:45:10,559] how does that translate into business impact? They don't know that. They don't have that
[00:45:11,119 -> 00:45:20,800] knowledge for granted. So I guess in order to be successful in tech as a PhD,
[00:45:21,760 -> 00:45:25,639] knowing, have the domain expertise and have the
[00:45:25,679 -> 00:45:29,039] knowledge, the skill is important. But being able to
[00:45:29,039 -> 00:45:34,159] communicate to a way that most people, like engineers and PMs,
[00:45:34,320 -> 00:45:37,719] you can expect them to have a certain type of level of
[00:45:37,719 -> 00:45:40,599] knowledge, but not as sophisticated as sophisticated
[00:45:40,599 -> 00:45:44,719] as you are. Being able to communicate is also important.
[00:45:44,079 -> 00:45:50,440] sophisticated as you are, being able to communicate is also important. So that is a skill. That is not a type of job that
[00:45:50,440 -> 00:45:53,440] is more of a skill that you, you should have in order to be
[00:45:53,440 -> 00:45:55,559] successful, to be successful.
[00:46:04,559 -> 00:46:09,840] So my question is that as a PhD of economics, you have all the backgrounds of the economics and aesthetics. So the job for a
[00:46:09,840 -> 00:46:14,400] consultant is kind of like fit for you, because you have all
[00:46:14,400 -> 00:46:19,920] the knowledge is so as a consultant, you have to have
[00:46:19,920 -> 00:46:23,920] a lot of knowledge of economics, and you have to have a lot of
[00:46:23,920 -> 00:46:25,000] knowledge of economics fit for you
[00:46:26,360 -> 00:46:28,099] because you have all the knowledges.
[00:46:28,099 -> 00:46:32,599] So as an engineering student as me,
[00:46:32,599 -> 00:46:34,960] I don't have a lot of economics background.
[00:46:34,960 -> 00:46:39,960] So do you have any advice for me to get some resources,
[00:46:40,440 -> 00:46:47,659] to get those knowledges to prepare for the, you know, future consultant or, you know, potential jobs at
[00:46:48,039 -> 00:46:50,039] these kind of fields.
[00:46:50,639 -> 00:46:55,840] Good question. So the, my friend who prepared me for my interview is a
[00:46:56,920 -> 00:46:59,559] biochemistry PhD.
[00:47:00,440 -> 00:47:05,000] The first consultant I worked with is a mechanical engineering PhD.
[00:47:05,000 -> 00:47:15,000] I will say there are less social science PhD at consultant than there are engineering or science PhDs.
[00:47:15,000 -> 00:47:28,280] So, and when I did the consulting interview, they didn't care about my economics background, to care about how I performed in case interviews, to care about how my business sense but they
[00:47:28,280 -> 00:47:32,599] didn't care about my degree. And a lot of times I think having a
[00:47:32,599 -> 00:47:38,840] sense of hard science background gives you the extra edge because
[00:47:39,679 -> 00:47:44,039] you can actually understand the hard problems that your clients
[00:47:44,079 -> 00:47:45,400] are facing. So
[00:47:45,400 -> 00:47:50,920] for example, if your client is a auto manufacturer, then being a
[00:47:50,920 -> 00:47:55,480] mechanical engineer and PhD is a very good boost.
[00:47:58,400 -> 00:48:03,480] So thanks. So is there a fundamental like requirement to
[00:48:05,239 -> 00:48:05,280] So is there a fundamental like requirement to, to, you know,
[00:48:11,000 -> 00:48:15,400] let the HR think, oh, you are at least being able to understand those economics fundamentals? Is there a class I need to take or
[00:48:15,400 -> 00:48:17,920] you advise me to take for the
[00:48:18,039 -> 00:48:21,519] internship is the best way to signal that you are qualified to
[00:48:21,519 -> 00:48:24,840] HR. So get a PTA, get an internship at a second tier
[00:48:24,840 -> 00:48:27,199] consulting company, like get a get the best internship,
[00:48:27,239 -> 00:48:30,079] you can get. That's how to HR.
[00:48:30,880 -> 00:48:31,840] I see. Thanks.
[00:48:36,599 -> 00:48:40,400] I guess I can follow up on this question. So for me personally,
[00:48:40,400 -> 00:48:44,239] I'm considering a transfer future goal is to start a
[00:48:44,239 -> 00:48:49,239] startup. But there are basically a lot of traffic, a lot
[00:48:49,239 -> 00:48:53,079] of ways I can take to achieve that goal. So right now I'm
[00:48:53,079 -> 00:48:58,039] thinking about two sense. The first way is to enter consulting
[00:48:58,039 -> 00:49:01,039] for a couple of years, build out my connections, and then use
[00:49:01,039 -> 00:49:04,920] that connections and resources to help me to build a successful
[00:49:04,920 -> 00:49:05,760] startup.
[00:49:05,760 -> 00:49:09,579] A second, but this actually one of the sense,
[00:49:09,579 -> 00:49:13,079] in the previous talk, the previous speaker was really,
[00:49:13,079 -> 00:49:14,239] he doesn't like this idea,
[00:49:14,239 -> 00:49:16,000] cause he's running startups.
[00:49:16,000 -> 00:49:19,840] And he will recommend that instead of going to consulting,
[00:49:19,840 -> 00:49:24,239] I should consider going into joining a startup directly.
[00:49:24,239 -> 00:49:28,079] So how do you compare these two different chats if my future
[00:49:28,079 -> 00:49:29,800] goal is to build a company?
[00:49:32,599 -> 00:49:39,440] So I think that there are too many variables in that decision.
[00:49:39,519 -> 00:49:42,280] Like for example, if you know the startup is going to be
[00:49:42,280 -> 00:49:47,039] successful, then do that. But I guess that's the uncertainty, right? So the safe
[00:49:47,039 -> 00:49:51,599] path is to join industry, build our experience and you know,
[00:49:52,679 -> 00:49:57,079] take the challenge when you feel you need to or see for you to
[00:49:57,079 -> 00:50:05,800] or when it is, it's like a hood of success is like, but I guess
[00:50:05,800 -> 00:50:08,840] different people have just different risk appetite and
[00:50:08,880 -> 00:50:14,440] different expertise. So I don't know how I can give her a
[00:50:14,440 -> 00:50:16,079] condition. Okay.
[00:50:19,519 -> 00:50:20,079] Excuse me.
[00:50:30,000 -> 00:50:31,000] Excuse me. I have a question. Yeah.
[00:50:31,000 -> 00:50:47,860] I'm curious about, like, you're as a senior data scientist, I'm curious about what the most important techniques or tools you are using in your daily work. I wonder if there's any gaps between the just for the data science and then a gap
[00:50:47,860 -> 00:50:52,019] between the industry and lab, because I'm working on some like
[00:50:52,019 -> 00:50:56,019] a very complicated deep learning or machine learning models. I'm
[00:50:56,139 -> 00:51:01,719] I'm more I'm curious if that is useful in your real work
[00:51:01,739 -> 00:51:02,380] industry.
[00:51:02,820 -> 00:51:05,239] Yes, yes, very.
[00:51:05,239 -> 00:51:08,199] So I guess my two different jobs, right?
[00:51:08,199 -> 00:51:11,440] Facebook, what I do is I run SQL to get data
[00:51:11,440 -> 00:51:13,800] and I use Tableau to plot the data
[00:51:13,800 -> 00:51:16,480] and I use PPT to present the data.
[00:51:16,480 -> 00:51:17,320] That's almost it.
[00:51:17,320 -> 00:51:18,800] And then I write docs.
[00:51:18,800 -> 00:51:21,400] I guess the writing training I received at PhD
[00:51:21,400 -> 00:51:23,039] was actually quite useful.
[00:51:23,039 -> 00:51:27,920] I'm able to produce high quality notes. It's almost like a mini research
[00:51:27,920 -> 00:51:33,760] paper. It's a good speed. So that helped me to land a lot of
[00:51:33,760 -> 00:51:38,880] impact. I sometimes use Python to do data cleaning and do some
[00:51:38,880 -> 00:51:43,440] simple analysis models. But I often use Tableau because the
[00:51:43,440 -> 00:51:48,460] problem just requires Tableau to solve. A-B testing is a must at Facebook,
[00:51:48,500 -> 00:51:51,260] being able to do causal inference based on A-B testing,
[00:51:51,260 -> 00:51:55,300] design the experiment, also data are not contaminated, all those
[00:51:55,300 -> 00:52:03,659] things are a must. At Amazon, I use Spark, Python, mostly
[00:52:03,739 -> 00:52:06,440] because the infrastructure at Amazon is
[00:52:06,440 -> 00:52:09,920] not as good as Facebook. So how to get the data I have to
[00:52:10,159 -> 00:52:14,159] basically set up the machines, the servers to get the data and
[00:52:14,639 -> 00:52:18,840] build the data pipeline, clean the data, and then use Python to
[00:52:18,880 -> 00:52:24,559] to run some. What I did is synthetic cohort and measures
[00:52:24,559 -> 00:52:25,360] completion so simple, simple machine learning models, not And what I did is synthetic cohort and measures completion.
[00:52:25,360 -> 00:52:28,920] So simple machine learning models, not deep learning
[00:52:28,920 -> 00:52:33,920] models, to draw causal inference based on big data set.
[00:52:33,920 -> 00:52:39,920] But I feel like if you can code deep learning model,
[00:52:39,920 -> 00:52:42,320] all the tech requirements should be easy.
[00:52:42,320 -> 00:52:48,039] It's just about preparing for the interview, shopping or communication. And we have a
[00:52:48,039 -> 00:52:51,000] video up incoming to talk about that.
[00:52:52,159 -> 00:52:52,880] Yeah, thank you.
[00:52:54,840 -> 00:53:03,199] Hi. Can you hear me? Okay. So thank you for your presentation
[00:53:03,199 -> 00:53:09,000] and your insight so far. And I'm currently a master's student. And my
[00:53:09,000 -> 00:53:15,360] question is about getting a job in the US after after having a
[00:53:15,360 -> 00:53:21,440] PhD degree. And so as far as I know, in some countries, such as
[00:53:21,639 -> 00:53:30,480] in Germany, sometimes getting a PhD degree is not a good thing because sometimes
[00:53:31,360 -> 00:53:38,719] the companies think that you are overqualified for the job and sometimes they don't want to
[00:53:38,719 -> 00:53:50,960] hire you because they will need to pay you more as compared to a master or a bachelor degree holder and so sometimes you know
[00:53:51,840 -> 00:53:58,880] having a PhD degree makes you less competitive for the job. So my question is can you tell me
[00:53:59,599 -> 00:54:07,440] the situation in the US? I mean can you give me some insight of like, having
[00:54:07,440 -> 00:54:14,599] a is like, is getting a PhD degree is a good thing. And it
[00:54:14,599 -> 00:54:20,960] helps you to to easier finding a job in the US. Yeah, thank you.
[00:54:20,960 -> 00:54:21,639] It's my question.
[00:54:21,840 -> 00:54:28,519] Yeah, so that's my, my first advice is not to answer questions to don't get a PhD. If
[00:54:28,800 -> 00:54:33,119] if our purpose is just to boost our job competitive, like if, if
[00:54:33,159 -> 00:54:38,079] your purpose is to make it easier to apply for a job. Don't
[00:54:38,079 -> 00:54:42,960] get don't get into PhD PhD is designed for research for
[00:54:42,960 -> 00:54:48,599] academia, like we happen to be trained well to be able to do other
[00:54:48,599 -> 00:54:52,800] things. But if you don't like research or academia, it's very
[00:54:52,800 -> 00:54:56,119] difficult to survive. Like I found it difficult to survive
[00:54:56,119 -> 00:54:59,599] myself, even though I liked every piece of my research and
[00:54:59,599 -> 00:55:03,719] the reading papers, I was able to just study like do research
[00:55:03,719 -> 00:55:09,420] like for months without doing anything else. But even that was not a
[00:55:09,420 -> 00:55:14,099] pleasant experience. So it's not worth it to, you know, to spend
[00:55:14,099 -> 00:55:17,099] five years in PhD just to be able to increase our likelihood
[00:55:17,099 -> 00:55:20,639] of getting a job. I feel like if you apply to an internship, and
[00:55:20,639 -> 00:55:25,960] you know, climb up the corporate ladder or whatever, it's much easier.
[00:55:25,960 -> 00:55:28,440] No, but yeah.
[00:55:28,440 -> 00:55:33,440] And I guess the relative competition,
[00:55:33,719 -> 00:55:36,480] or like, is it easier for PhDs to get jobs?
[00:55:36,480 -> 00:55:41,099] I think yes, because most of my PhD friends,
[00:55:41,099 -> 00:55:42,639] if they want to go to industry,
[00:55:42,639 -> 00:55:45,519] if they want to find a job, they can always do that. I haven't seen industry, if they want to find a job, they can always do that.
[00:55:46,480 -> 00:55:49,920] I haven't seen one case that they want to find a job but they couldn't.
[00:55:51,199 -> 00:55:54,880] Even if they couldn't stay in the United States, they can easily find a job back home.
[00:55:55,599 -> 00:56:01,360] Yeah, so one more quick question is that you think that the ranking of the university is a
[00:56:03,280 -> 00:56:07,360] of the university is a critical point, I mean, an important point in finding a job.
[00:56:07,360 -> 00:56:11,519] I mean, do the HR people will pay a lot of attention
[00:56:11,519 -> 00:56:12,719] to the ranking?
[00:56:12,719 -> 00:56:13,800] Yes.
[00:56:13,800 -> 00:56:14,800] OK.
[00:56:14,800 -> 00:56:17,440] Industry, yes.
[00:56:17,440 -> 00:56:19,000] Thank you.
[00:56:19,000 -> 00:56:21,519] Hey, I have a question.
[00:56:21,519 -> 00:56:26,239] So you just said that you are actually
[00:56:26,239 -> 00:56:28,199] very interested in academia and very
[00:56:28,199 -> 00:56:30,039] used to the lifestyle there.
[00:56:30,039 -> 00:56:33,760] But it's still difficult to survive academia.
[00:56:33,760 -> 00:56:35,519] I wonder, is that that difficult?
[00:56:35,519 -> 00:56:39,760] I mean, because you graduated from Cornell.
[00:56:39,760 -> 00:56:48,480] And if you want to go into academia, you can do that, right? I mean, so I'm just and also if you like, actually,
[00:56:48,519 -> 00:56:51,559] like, like from your description of your past PhD life, I feel
[00:56:51,559 -> 00:56:57,119] like, yeah, I feel like you're like, it's very simple, like,
[00:56:57,400 -> 00:57:00,920] like, I just wonder why you change the path, like, you know,
[00:57:02,599 -> 00:57:03,079] thanks.
[00:57:05,599 -> 00:57:09,800] If you want to be successful in academia, it's not impossible to
[00:57:09,800 -> 00:57:15,159] do. I guess it's not it's not very hard to do as well. Or like,
[00:57:15,320 -> 00:57:17,719] if you want to survive, it's not hard to do if you want to do
[00:57:17,719 -> 00:57:22,800] well, it's difficult, but it's still possible. My choice was
[00:57:22,800 -> 00:57:25,000] more related to that, you know, I just, I
[00:57:25,000 -> 00:57:29,480] realized, academia is not my passion. I'm passionate about a
[00:57:29,480 -> 00:57:34,079] very small part of it. The part of, you know, into being
[00:57:34,119 -> 00:57:38,199] intellectually challenged, solve the questions nobody have
[00:57:38,199 -> 00:57:41,760] solved before, like those parts, but I didn't like, you know,
[00:57:42,679 -> 00:57:45,760] rewriting the paper a hundred times,
[00:57:45,760 -> 00:57:49,780] going through a referee process, you know,
[00:57:49,780 -> 00:57:53,880] discussing all the like detail that nobody care about
[00:57:53,880 -> 00:57:56,559] in seminars or with our peers.
[00:57:56,559 -> 00:58:00,019] All those things were like very painful to me.
[00:58:00,019 -> 00:58:01,480] And that was not my passion.
[00:58:01,480 -> 00:58:04,159] I feel like I can, like for example,
[00:58:04,159 -> 00:58:06,579] consulting is a great place to find
[00:58:06,579 -> 00:58:08,639] the same intellectual challenge,
[00:58:08,639 -> 00:58:11,679] but solve problem that people actually care about.
[00:58:13,039 -> 00:58:13,860] Yeah.
[00:58:14,679 -> 00:58:15,719] I see, thank you.
[00:58:29,679 -> 00:58:40,519] Great, any other questions from the audience?
[00:58:43,480 -> 00:58:46,119] I think I see that there is a debate in the chat box about the requirement for advanced
[00:58:46,119 -> 00:58:50,360] degree in the necessity of it if you were to go to industry.
[00:58:50,360 -> 00:58:55,639] I think the clarification that we need to make here is if you think about different
[00:58:55,639 -> 00:59:02,960] career options on the spectrum and you know you rank it whether it's further away from
[00:59:02,960 -> 00:59:05,000] repure research or closer.
[00:59:05,360 -> 00:59:07,519] And I would probably put industry jobs
[00:59:07,519 -> 00:59:10,539] as on the closer end of the spectrum
[00:59:10,539 -> 00:59:14,079] to your actual research and maybe consulting banking
[00:59:14,079 -> 00:59:16,360] or VC on the other spectrum.
[00:59:16,360 -> 00:59:18,679] And there's another dimension,
[00:59:18,679 -> 00:59:22,519] which is also the requirement of specific knowledge
[00:59:22,519 -> 00:59:26,480] and expertise, and that's kind of the reverse to the spectrum.
[00:59:26,480 -> 00:59:31,480] So maybe you probably don't 100% need a PhD
[00:59:33,199 -> 00:59:36,679] to go to industry, but you probably need a master's
[00:59:36,679 -> 00:59:39,579] or related undergraduate degree.
[00:59:39,579 -> 00:59:42,800] And to be honest, I would say higher percentage
[00:59:42,800 -> 00:59:45,000] would require a related advanced degree.
[00:59:45,000 -> 00:59:54,000] But if you go to the other spectrum, if you were to go into banking, consulting, or anything else, it's completely not a requirement at all.
[00:59:54,000 -> 01:00:06,199] In that case, they will probably put more weight on other factors on your CV, such as your, you know, the ranking of your university, the diversity of your extracurricular
[01:00:06,199 -> 01:00:09,000] and any other passion you've shown
[01:00:09,000 -> 01:00:11,099] for their industry or sector?
[01:00:12,800 -> 01:00:14,719] Yeah, that's a good summary.
[01:00:14,719 -> 01:00:17,679] Like, I guess the one end of the spectrum
[01:00:17,679 -> 01:00:19,300] is being a professor, right?
[01:00:20,440 -> 01:00:22,320] You 100% need a PhD.
[01:00:22,320 -> 01:00:27,840] And being a researcher, probably a PhD will help. But I guess the previous question is about, you
[01:00:27,840 -> 01:00:32,239] know, if I want to apply for a job, is PhD going to help me
[01:00:32,239 -> 01:00:35,960] make it be more successful? If you want to be a professor or a
[01:00:35,960 -> 01:00:39,199] researcher, you wouldn't ask this question, because you know,
[01:00:39,239 -> 01:00:44,559] you need a PhD. So it's also, I guess, my answer was to the case
[01:00:44,559 -> 01:00:48,000] that a PhD is an option, but not a necessity.
[01:00:48,000 -> 01:00:52,000] So how should you choose and my advice is don't do it.
[01:00:52,000 -> 01:00:55,000] It's not worth it.
[01:00:55,000 -> 01:00:59,000] I have a question.
[01:00:59,000 -> 01:01:05,159] I have one more question on the data science career of yours.
[01:01:05,159 -> 01:01:07,079] Because a lot of people around me
[01:01:07,079 -> 01:01:10,280] seem to be wanting to be a data scientist.
[01:01:10,280 -> 01:01:12,719] Actually, everyone wants to be a data scientist nowadays.
[01:01:12,719 -> 01:01:17,039] And a lot of them have zero background in anything related.
[01:01:17,039 -> 01:01:20,199] They're probably in bioinformatics,
[01:01:20,199 -> 01:01:23,960] or in physics, or even chemistry.
[01:01:23,960 -> 01:01:27,679] So I wanted to know from people around you who are proper
[01:01:27,679 -> 01:01:33,360] data scientists, what is their background? How many people are actually from non-computer science,
[01:01:33,360 -> 01:01:43,760] non-math, non-economics background? And what do we see are kind of subjects or topics or
[01:01:46,079 -> 01:01:46,440] of subjects or, or, you know, topics or kind of their PhD
[01:01:51,400 -> 01:01:52,039] areas that could be a higher likelihood for them to enter
[01:01:52,960 -> 01:01:53,800] data science.
[01:01:59,079 -> 01:02:03,039] So first, data science is not a high bar. If a PhD have done quantitative research, whether psychology, a PhD or physics,
[01:02:03,039 -> 01:02:05,400] PhD, their skill skill
[01:02:05,400 -> 01:02:10,239] set is good enough for data scientist, because data
[01:02:10,239 -> 01:02:14,079] scientists is about application and about solving problems,
[01:02:14,119 -> 01:02:17,719] analytics application and solving problems. It's not about
[01:02:17,760 -> 01:02:22,559] building the most sophisticated models, right. And they actually
[01:02:22,760 -> 01:02:28,440] like companies hire specifically for machine learning engineers, research scientists or apply
[01:02:28,440 -> 01:02:32,360] scientists, that you know, go and build models and solve the
[01:02:32,360 -> 01:02:36,679] cutting edge artificial problems in artificial intelligence. For
[01:02:36,679 -> 01:02:39,760] example, how to make Amazon's recommendation system better.
[01:02:40,199 -> 01:02:45,159] That requires specific domain knowledge. But for format for my current role,
[01:02:45,199 -> 01:02:49,960] data scientists, as I said, like, second, second year,
[01:02:50,239 -> 01:02:56,920] second, like sophomore, sophomore level of statistic in
[01:02:56,920 -> 01:03:01,960] college, not in PhD, is enough to handle most cases. So if you
[01:03:01,960 -> 01:03:06,400] had done quality quantitative research,
[01:03:14,239 -> 01:03:17,039] you have the skill set. Yeah, like, forgot what the question was. Did that answer the question?
[01:03:27,079 -> 01:03:27,400] Yes. Yeah, like, most PhDs, they're qualified. It's just about the experience and
[01:03:32,679 -> 01:03:35,079] interview. So get your resume to pass the HR stage and then prepare to interview so the hiring manager hires you.
[01:03:39,559 -> 01:03:40,159] Thank you.
[01:03:42,519 -> 01:03:49,159] Okay, like I might have a question, like you mentioned that it would be much better if
[01:03:49,159 -> 01:03:58,320] you could have started preparing for a job like searching at the second year of your
[01:03:58,320 -> 01:03:59,320] PhD.
[01:03:59,320 -> 01:04:08,400] But my question is that like usually like a lot of research takes a long time, much more than two years
[01:04:08,400 -> 01:04:10,480] to even get on track.
[01:04:10,480 -> 01:04:17,880] So what's your suggestion on determining what's the starting point?
[01:04:17,880 -> 01:04:24,320] Because I discussed with some of my friends on when to decide it is the time to quit or
[01:04:24,320 -> 01:04:29,400] to continue. Like my idea is more like maybe it is more about
[01:04:29,400 -> 01:04:33,480] rewarding you have like the more rewarding your rewards you have
[01:04:33,500 -> 01:04:38,840] during your PhD as a academic research and then probably we
[01:04:38,840 -> 01:04:43,199] will continue more on this trend. I guess at this past on
[01:04:43,559 -> 01:04:45,519] like, I just want to hear about
[01:04:45,519 -> 01:04:52,960] like your thoughts on when to decide on the on your past.
[01:04:53,480 -> 01:04:54,280] Yeah, thank you.
[01:04:54,840 -> 01:05:02,280] Yeah. So, I guess I need to clarify, that was my own lesson
[01:05:02,320 -> 01:05:08,360] and what I would have done differently if I started again, everyone's situation is different from my
[01:05:08,360 -> 01:05:14,599] advice is no interest, no, no, strength and no self basically,
[01:05:14,840 -> 01:05:18,559] and then make the decision based on our own scenario, not mine.
[01:05:18,599 -> 01:05:23,800] Right. And but for me, the reason I said I wanted to do to
[01:05:23,800 -> 01:05:28,119] start in my second year is, of course, like my research would take a long
[01:05:28,119 -> 01:05:32,960] time to build. But I stayed six years, I wanted to do acting, I
[01:05:32,960 -> 01:05:36,280] had the counterfactual right had wanted to do acting, I stayed
[01:05:36,280 -> 01:05:39,559] those years, but I wasn't particularly proud of my
[01:05:40,679 -> 01:05:44,039] research paper. It is an important topic, I think is
[01:05:44,199 -> 01:05:49,800] research paper, like it is an important topic, I think is a nicely written paper, but there was no impact. And because what
[01:05:49,800 -> 01:05:53,920] drives me is impact, right? So I don't care. Like, if I, if I
[01:05:53,920 -> 01:05:57,920] stay in my PhD for four years and had a much crappy paper,
[01:05:58,119 -> 01:06:01,960] much crappier paper, I would actually be happier today. So
[01:06:03,000 -> 01:06:06,659] that's why I said, if I do it again,
[01:06:06,659 -> 01:06:08,519] I would start in my second year.
[01:06:08,519 -> 01:06:10,000] But I know everyone's different.
[01:06:10,000 -> 01:06:12,719] So definitely today just make a decision
[01:06:12,719 -> 01:06:14,159] based on our own scenario.
[01:06:16,039 -> 01:06:17,039] Yeah, thank you.
[01:06:17,039 -> 01:06:18,000] Yeah, thanks.
[01:06:21,480 -> 01:06:23,159] I guess to follow up on that,
[01:06:23,159 -> 01:06:27,119] Yujun, is there a moment in your current life where you think back, you say, okay, if I were to follow up on that, you john, is there a moment, you know, current life, we will think back, you say, Okay, if I
[01:06:27,119 -> 01:06:29,599] were to continue and Damian, maybe, you know, I will be a
[01:06:29,599 -> 01:06:34,639] professor. You have no, so you have no moments of regret,
[01:06:34,639 -> 01:06:34,880] right?
[01:06:35,920 -> 01:06:40,880] Just, of course, it's not helpful to regret things. Like,
[01:06:40,960 -> 01:06:45,280] like I said, I'll do HR, I'll do it differently.
[01:06:45,280 -> 01:06:52,440] But I that is more as a device for like this people who are in
[01:06:52,440 -> 01:06:57,840] a PhD program. If I choose my life, I wouldn't necessarily
[01:06:57,840 -> 01:07:01,760] want to do it all over again, because I got I'm happy with my
[01:07:01,760 -> 01:07:04,639] current life, right? So everything that leads to my
[01:07:04,639 -> 01:07:07,280] current life, I think, you know, that they're
[01:07:07,280 -> 01:07:11,639] good. I don't have any particular regrets. And it took
[01:07:11,639 -> 01:07:15,400] me six years to realize I wasn't in leukemia. Maybe that's,
[01:07:15,679 -> 01:07:20,280] that's what I need. If I change my decision in my second year,
[01:07:20,280 -> 01:07:25,159] maybe I will always have self doubt, you know, what, then maybe I'll have
[01:07:25,159 -> 01:07:27,599] questions, like you just mentioned, you know, what, what,
[01:07:27,639 -> 01:07:31,400] what if today I don't have what if because I suffered those six
[01:07:31,400 -> 01:07:35,559] years and I realized, you know, that's not my passion. Okay,
[01:07:35,639 -> 01:07:36,599] that's a good point.
[01:07:43,519 -> 01:07:47,280] And of the jobs you did, I know you had experience startup things, some experience in consulting, and now data
[01:07:47,280 -> 01:07:52,000] scientists, what is the job you like most, or you, the bet on
[01:07:52,039 -> 01:07:54,920] using the best is yet to come. So what you know what I was
[01:07:54,920 -> 01:07:55,760] thinking right now,
[01:07:56,000 -> 01:08:03,519] on my current job. Otherwise, I would have like, so I guess some
[01:08:03,519 -> 01:08:08,800] some data points to back my kind of, you know, my, my current job. Otherwise, I would have like, so I guess some some data points
[01:08:08,800 -> 01:08:14,039] to back my claim. Amazon has a very particular stock vesting
[01:08:14,239 -> 01:08:16,880] schedule. So when you go to a tech company, they give you
[01:08:16,880 -> 01:08:21,560] stocks for four years. But Amazon the first year it was 5%,
[01:08:21,600 -> 01:08:26,600] second year 15%, third and fourth 40% each. And when I
[01:08:26,600 -> 01:08:30,520] joined Amazon, Amazon stock was at 800 something. Now it's at
[01:08:30,560 -> 01:08:35,760] 3000. So I was actually underpaid in Facebook, when I
[01:08:35,760 -> 01:08:40,119] took the Facebook job. And so I get paid less at Facebook than
[01:08:40,119 -> 01:08:45,680] I was at Amazon. But I wanted to try the job so I can like if
[01:08:45,680 -> 01:08:48,039] I'm not happy at Facebook, I would go to another job.
[01:08:57,800 -> 01:09:00,520] Great. Any other questions from the audience?
[01:09:12,500 -> 01:09:15,000] I guess we have a lot of comments in the chat box. I try to speak because I cannot.
[01:09:15,000 -> 01:09:18,000] Yeah, yeah, I was muted.
[01:09:18,000 -> 01:09:23,279] I have a two buttons need to unmute so I'm mute one and the other still muted so you
[01:09:23,279 -> 01:09:28,000] can hear me now.
[01:09:28,000 -> 01:09:36,000] Okay, so I put some text comments because previously I got some technical problems to unmute both.
[01:09:36,000 -> 01:09:45,000] It's good, it's good communication we can talk more. So, so today, like I put in the comments, things are changing.
[01:09:45,100 -> 01:09:48,300] Like 20, 30 years ago, if I had PhD,
[01:09:48,300 -> 01:09:51,899] the industry labs will value you more,
[01:09:51,899 -> 01:09:53,760] but today can be different.
[01:09:57,979 -> 01:10:02,899] Yeah, I'm looking at the discussion in the chats.
[01:10:02,899 -> 01:10:06,000] I think there are two things I want to address.
[01:10:06,439 -> 01:10:12,479] One is like still like we focus on the job that requires a PhD.
[01:10:12,600 -> 01:10:16,399] So if you are a PhD, you know, that is our advantage because
[01:10:16,399 -> 01:10:20,960] this jobs. You all have a comparative advantage of being a
[01:10:20,960 -> 01:10:27,640] PhD. So as a PhD definitely focus on those jobs or not focus but you know, pay more attention to those
[01:10:27,640 -> 01:10:32,159] jobs and apply and you'll be successful. I don't know the
[01:10:32,159 -> 01:10:37,319] future, but at least you know, darker jobs. But the second is,
[01:10:38,359 -> 01:10:44,319] like, for example, a lot of big companies have to do research,
[01:10:44,800 -> 01:10:52,279] of big companies have to do research, they have their research department. Yes. And, but don't take industry job as
[01:10:52,279 -> 01:10:57,840] an escape, we cannot do academia well. Like, for example, the
[01:10:57,880 -> 01:11:06,840] Google AI or Facebook AI research. Those are the, they hire the best PhDs, right. So,
[01:11:07,600 -> 01:11:11,439] like, if you want to get into the right, very good, the
[01:11:11,439 -> 01:11:18,079] promising industry research career, you need to be very good
[01:11:18,079 -> 01:11:22,439] at academia, research and creation research that actually
[01:11:22,439 -> 01:11:25,000] has an impact. So I
[01:11:26,880 -> 01:11:33,680] guess those are my two points.
[01:11:37,439 -> 01:11:44,239] Yeah, is the AI is a unique area because the company like a Google, Amazon, they tried to hire the best AI scientists
[01:11:44,239 -> 01:11:45,880] develop the most advanced
[01:11:45,880 -> 01:11:51,239] algorithms. But to develop the AI applications that need or
[01:11:51,239 -> 01:11:52,760] desire to have PhDs.
[01:11:55,000 -> 01:11:58,039] Yeah, and I talked about that in my YouTube channel as well. I
[01:11:58,039 -> 01:12:01,119] feel like a lot of industry application of machine learning
[01:12:01,119 -> 01:12:03,680] is actually an engineering problem, not a science problem.
[01:12:03,720 -> 01:12:05,680] You don't need to develop algorithm to do that.
[01:12:05,920 -> 01:12:10,119] You just need to apply the Python packages to solve, you
[01:12:10,119 -> 01:12:13,359] need you need to define the problem, they need to apply the
[01:12:13,359 -> 01:12:15,520] right Python packages to solve it.
[01:12:20,520 -> 01:12:22,680] Does anyone have any follow up questions?
[01:12:23,119 -> 01:12:27,600] Yeah, we're at the final question. Okay, yeah, so the final one. Yeah.
[01:12:28,159 -> 01:12:34,479] Thank you for the topic. Very sensory content is your personal
[01:12:34,479 -> 01:12:41,039] experience. So my first, can you hear me. Just to confirm. Okay,
[01:12:48,000 -> 01:12:55,239] confirm. Okay, so my question is, after that, that's yet after this year's PhD, everyone wants to have that game more from the
[01:12:55,279 -> 01:13:00,239] PhD experience. But right now you choose to go through the
[01:13:00,279 -> 01:13:04,960] industry and compete with the master student and some
[01:13:04,960 -> 01:13:05,359] undergraduate students. Some of them are your boss right now. to the industry and compete with the master's students and some
[01:13:05,359 -> 01:13:10,159] undergraduate students. Some of them are your boss right now. So
[01:13:10,159 -> 01:13:17,920] how do you how do you take this situation? How do you
[01:13:17,920 -> 01:13:28,319] accept someone is someone with only a master's degree guide to is your boss
[01:13:28,319 -> 01:13:28,840] right now.
[01:13:30,680 -> 01:13:35,079] I didn't capture the kind of type maybe.
[01:13:35,159 -> 01:13:39,640] So I think he was asking. So right now we enter industry for
[01:13:39,640 -> 01:13:43,520] example, in Facebook, or for example, if your boss, he only
[01:13:43,520 -> 01:13:46,119] has a master's degree, how do you feel about that?
[01:13:50,000 -> 01:13:54,239] What's that meritocracy? Yeah, like, the PhD doesn't tell you
[01:13:54,239 -> 01:13:58,199] you are better. Having a PhD just is a certification that
[01:13:58,199 -> 01:14:00,920] you're completing a PhD program. It doesn't mean you're better
[01:14:00,920 -> 01:14:04,439] than a master. So I guess if your boss is better than you
[01:14:04,439 -> 01:14:07,239] listen to him, your idea is better than him, you try to convince him your
[01:14:07,239 -> 01:14:14,680] idea is better. But I don't view the title, like the title. The
[01:14:14,680 -> 01:14:16,199] title doesn't shouldn't mean anything.
[01:14:20,520 -> 01:14:21,680] Okay, thank you.
[01:14:28,640 -> 01:14:31,840] Yes, I guess. So we are coming to one half hours, and I really appreciate you john to take this opportunity to share the
[01:14:31,840 -> 01:14:34,960] advice with Oh, there any other comment.
[01:14:39,479 -> 01:14:42,000] Looks like there's another question. So this is definitely
[01:14:42,000 -> 01:14:47,640] the last one. So I can paraphrase. So he was asking, I
[01:14:47,640 -> 01:14:50,560] don't know if the competition between China and the US would
[01:14:50,560 -> 01:14:53,000] inspire my investments to fundamental fundamental
[01:14:53,000 -> 01:14:57,760] research. What is the take on that seem like right right now
[01:14:57,760 -> 01:14:58,640] this is a trend.
[01:15:00,479 -> 01:15:04,199] I don't know. And I don't care like, what can I do to change
[01:15:04,199 -> 01:15:10,920] that? No. So yeah,
[01:15:11,319 -> 01:15:16,279] I agree on that. So let's thank our speaker again for sharing
[01:15:16,600 -> 01:15:21,640] his useful advice in making these decisions in throughout
[01:15:21,640 -> 01:15:26,000] the PhD. And also, thank all the audience for coming today. And
[01:15:26,039 -> 01:15:30,880] especially for we are running this talk series and that talk
[01:15:30,880 -> 01:15:35,680] is going to be centered around consulting. So, if you're
[01:15:35,680 -> 01:15:41,560] interested, just follow our Twitter, follow our WeChat
[01:15:41,560 -> 01:15:44,520] accounts, we'll be releasing announcements. And let's thank

[01:15:58,760 -> 01:16:03,479] People are interested in variety of career tracks. And let's keep
[01:16:03,479 -> 01:16:12,000] in touch.
[01:16:16,000 -> 01:16:18,000] Oh, hey. Can I also introduce myself here.
[01:16:23,000 -> 01:16:26,239] Sure, go ahead. Oh, sure. Yeah. So, so my name is Jen Jen Joe and
[01:16:26,239 -> 01:16:30,600] I'm now a PhD student in computer science in Georgia Tech. And yeah,
[01:16:30,600 -> 01:16:35,159] I used to be a master's student in University of Michigan, and
[01:16:35,159 -> 01:16:40,880] I am glad to see you guys here and I'm never like I think, I
[01:16:40,880 -> 01:16:43,159] thought like too seriously about what I'm going to do in the
[01:16:43,159 -> 01:16:48,079] future. But like so but like accidentally I think, thought like too seriously about what I'm going to do in the future. But like, so, but like accidentally I got added
[01:16:48,079 -> 01:16:49,819] in the WeChat, I'm very glad.
[01:16:49,819 -> 01:16:53,619] And actually I saw some friends who like do consulting jobs
[01:16:53,619 -> 01:16:56,399] and like, it is a very appealing job for me.
[01:16:56,399 -> 01:16:59,460] And I want to explore more and see what it's like.
[01:16:59,460 -> 01:17:00,380] Yeah, thanks.
[01:17:01,760 -> 01:17:03,439] Jiangjiang, it's good to see you.
[01:17:03,439 -> 01:17:05,760] We have been WeChat friends for a long time, but it's
[01:17:05,760 -> 01:17:07,000] the first time I saw you.
[01:17:07,000 -> 01:17:10,000] Yeah, nice to see you.
