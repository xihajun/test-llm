[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,700] I think the Chinese consumer is very conscious about what they're putting in their body.
[00:00:05,700 -> 00:00:08,560] But not everyone's going to accept that exactly, you know.
[00:00:08,560 -> 00:00:13,820] In America, you can be in control of the guest experience, 100%.
[00:00:13,820 -> 00:00:18,260] And what it's taught me about the local palate, I like the most.
[00:00:18,260 -> 00:00:24,420] I do not like serving white truffles because it allows, it's in the concept that you need
[00:00:24,420 -> 00:00:28,960] to be spending time on research and development, on thinking, on innovating.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,839] it's almost an oxymoron in... I mean they can do fine dining. I mean every chef I
[00:00:05,839 -> 00:00:10,119] think has to be a good host. I would say the overall concept of the food doesn't
[00:00:10,119 -> 00:00:16,120] change very much. Yeah so that's kind of the first question right? How different
[00:00:16,120 -> 00:00:23,640] it is in the United States and here. Here is starting but changing.
[00:00:23,640 -> 00:00:28,719] I think people are following the trend but they don't yet know why. But if you
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,679] Like you just talked about health and you know, I think the Chinese consumer is very
[00:00:06,559 -> 00:00:11,119] very conscious about what they're putting in their body, you know, the types of
[00:00:12,080 -> 00:00:16,000] allergies or restrictions are very different than in America and Canada.
[00:00:16,000 -> 00:00:18,239] What type of allergies are here?
[00:00:18,239 -> 00:00:23,359] It's, you know, depending on the type of the time of the month, if they've had surgery,
[00:00:23,359 -> 00:00:27,359] inflammation, time of the day, you know.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,000] Shi Qi, the wetness.
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:06,000] You're very conscious about these things,
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:12,000] but we don't think about all of the chemicals or pesticides in industrial farming.
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:18,000] But if you connect these two, you would realize it's actually something you should also be very concerned about.
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:24,000] And we have a lot of people that won't eat raw food, including vegetables,
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,860] Because at a time, it was just sanitary to cook everything.
[00:00:06,860 -> 00:00:09,199] But now I think the minds are changing.
[00:00:09,199 -> 00:00:14,160] Now if we serve a cold salad, it's...
[00:00:14,160 -> 00:00:15,279] Acceptable to most people.
[00:00:15,279 -> 00:00:17,440] Most people, but still not everyone yet.
[00:00:17,440 -> 00:00:20,640] Even in this restaurant, which I think is fascinating.
[00:00:20,640 -> 00:00:29,800] So one of the biggest challenges is presenting this concept to people
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,419] who may not yet appreciate it.
[00:00:05,879 -> 00:00:10,880] What are the other challenges in trying to
[00:00:12,500 -> 00:00:14,820] do more of what you want to do?
[00:00:16,160 -> 00:00:21,160] You mean, like how can I do more?
[00:00:22,660 -> 00:00:25,339] The challenges of trying to do more.
[00:00:25,339 -> 00:00:27,859] Like you have a vision, right?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,680] and you try to get to that vision
[00:00:02,680 -> 00:00:05,400] and you have to try to balance many things.
[00:00:05,400 -> 00:00:06,240] Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:06,240 -> 00:00:11,240] I mean, the vision is way down in the future
[00:00:12,019 -> 00:00:13,919] in the countryside somewhere.
[00:00:13,919 -> 00:00:18,339] It's not in the city, but in the city, in this restaurant,
[00:00:20,679 -> 00:00:23,640] yeah, we do have to balance what the guests want
[00:00:23,640 -> 00:00:24,480] at the end of the day.
[00:00:24,480 -> 00:00:28,079] So I can choose my menu
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,120] And this is what I think is amazing right now.
[00:00:02,120 -> 00:00:04,459] And it's different from last season,
[00:00:04,459 -> 00:00:07,360] and it's a new expression, a new artistic journey.
[00:00:08,519 -> 00:00:10,759] But not everyone's gonna accept that exactly.
[00:00:11,640 -> 00:00:13,279] You always have to change, like I said,
[00:00:13,279 -> 00:00:15,359] depending on the restrictions,
[00:00:15,359 -> 00:00:17,920] I'm gonna have to change dishes, preferences.
[00:00:20,239 -> 00:00:24,280] I think, and this is also something I'm learning too,
[00:00:24,280 -> 00:00:28,280] is that in America, you can be in control
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,200] the guest experience 100% and they actually love that.
[00:00:03,200 -> 00:00:04,200] Yeah.
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:05,200] They don't want to have any choice.
[00:00:05,200 -> 00:00:08,400] You know, I show up and you're going to tell me what I'm going to eat, what I'm going to
[00:00:08,400 -> 00:00:13,439] drink, what's going to happen, where I'm going to do and like, you know, like the Blue Hill
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:16,519] experience they take you around as part of this whole experience.
[00:00:16,519 -> 00:00:21,760] But here I think that, you know, the Chinese consumer still wants a lot of choice.
[00:00:21,760 -> 00:00:24,079] Like an a la carte menu would be more successful.
[00:00:24,079 -> 00:00:25,519] And so I'm always balancing.
[00:00:25,519 -> 00:00:27,199] I can't do full choice.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:08,839] I still have to offer supplements, options around restrictions, more choices, and we're
[00:00:08,839 -> 00:00:12,039] heading in that direction to keep adding more and more choice.
[00:00:12,039 -> 00:00:14,880] Is that something I want to do?
[00:00:14,880 -> 00:00:15,880] No.
[00:00:15,880 -> 00:00:16,879] No, no, no.
[00:00:16,879 -> 00:00:20,399] Is that because they're not used to this, a set menu?
[00:00:20,399 -> 00:00:21,399] Or is it because...
[00:00:21,399 -> 00:00:24,000] I think it's a lot of different factors.
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:26,480] They spend a lot of money, they want to have more control.
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:28,120] Yeah, they want a little bit more control.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,679] not used to giving it up, especially if you're a boss at Lauballen.
[00:00:05,679 -> 00:00:12,000] They want to have the option that only so many people can choose.
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:16,600] So like, yes, this is the price of the menu, but I also want to be able to buy something
[00:00:16,600 -> 00:00:17,600] extra.
[00:00:17,600 -> 00:00:20,320] You already stand through alcohol.
[00:00:20,320 -> 00:00:28,480] Yeah, alcohol is one of them, but also just luxury products.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,200] They offer that in other fine dining restaurants, like White Truffle.
[00:00:05,200 -> 00:00:09,199] Yeah, I mean, we do that here as well.
[00:00:09,199 -> 00:00:14,800] I have another way of asking a similar but the other side of the question.
[00:00:14,800 -> 00:00:23,960] So the compromise you made, which one do you think is the one you actually liked or felt
[00:00:23,960 -> 00:00:27,320] necessary and which one you hated the most?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,480] I mean, we have to compromise on local palate.
[00:00:07,480 -> 00:00:14,560] And what it's taught me about the local palate, I like the most, because it's teaching me
[00:00:14,560 -> 00:00:16,019] a different way to taste things.
[00:00:16,019 -> 00:00:17,120] It's opening my mind up.
[00:00:17,120 -> 00:00:18,879] It's educating me.
[00:00:18,879 -> 00:00:20,640] And I think that's...
[00:00:20,640 -> 00:00:21,879] It's also taught me a lot about...
[00:00:21,879 -> 00:00:27,960] I think the Chinese, I always say, has a sixth taste.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,839] You know, like they say the Japanese sixth taste is umami.
[00:00:02,839 -> 00:00:04,719] I think the Chinese is texture.
[00:00:04,719 -> 00:00:05,219] Oh, yeah.
[00:00:05,219 -> 00:00:05,719] And.
[00:00:05,719 -> 00:00:07,519] I read about your visual texture.
[00:00:07,519 -> 00:00:08,019] Yeah.
[00:00:08,019 -> 00:00:09,240] I noticed that in the food.
[00:00:09,240 -> 00:00:09,740] Yeah.
[00:00:09,740 -> 00:00:14,080] So I think it's really opened my mind up to what texture is
[00:00:14,080 -> 00:00:17,199] and how to approach texture, both flavor, visually,
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:18,640] artistically, everything.
[00:00:18,640 -> 00:00:21,519] And so that's been the biggest education coming to China
[00:00:21,519 -> 00:00:23,359] for me as a chef.
[00:00:23,359 -> 00:00:26,359] And I think no matter where I am in the future,
[00:00:26,359 -> 00:00:27,559] that's going to come with me.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,000] and that appreciation and understanding.
[00:00:03,000 -> 00:00:08,000] And then, yeah, compromise that I don't like is,
[00:00:08,859 -> 00:00:10,820] you know, doing something for the guest
[00:00:12,179 -> 00:00:14,140] to make them happy, that I know-
[00:00:14,140 -> 00:00:15,039] To feed their ego.
[00:00:15,039 -> 00:00:16,339] Yeah, to feed their ego,
[00:00:16,339 -> 00:00:19,100] that I think compromises on our philosophy.
[00:00:20,379 -> 00:00:22,019] So one is serving white truffles.
[00:00:22,019 -> 00:00:24,059] I do not like serving white truffles
[00:00:24,059 -> 00:00:28,059] because it doesn't fit our concept of using local products,
[00:00:28,059 -> 00:00:29,539] but it's something we have to do in China.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,679] If we're not doing white truffles, then we're going to lose out on a lot of money.
[00:00:06,679 -> 00:00:08,679] Maybe AD shouldn't hear this.
[00:00:08,679 -> 00:00:17,440] I was not happy with doing white truffles, but I found it necessary.
[00:00:17,440 -> 00:00:20,199] You don't like?
[00:00:20,199 -> 00:00:22,559] For me, it's our concept.
[00:00:22,559 -> 00:00:26,079] It's about promoting Chinese products.
[00:00:26,079 -> 00:00:29,559] White truffles is kind of just something for the rich people.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,120] And you become just a caterer to money, and you stop being an artistic expression in my
[00:00:06,120 -> 00:00:07,120] mind.
[00:00:07,120 -> 00:00:10,119] But it is the single element that worked the most.
[00:00:10,119 -> 00:00:11,119] Yeah.
[00:00:11,119 -> 00:00:12,119] That's what I'm saying.
[00:00:12,119 -> 00:00:13,119] I can't do it.
[00:00:13,119 -> 00:00:14,119] I have to do it.
[00:00:14,119 -> 00:00:15,119] Yeah.
[00:00:15,119 -> 00:00:16,120] It's necessary.
[00:00:16,120 -> 00:00:18,179] I think it's fine.
[00:00:18,179 -> 00:00:21,859] But as long as you are able to hold on to your core, right?
[00:00:21,859 -> 00:00:27,719] And I feel like, at least from the dining experience yesterday, you have been quite
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,000] successful of doing that?
[00:00:02,000 -> 00:00:04,000] Yeah, I mean it's not just me obviously.
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:09,000] It's a lot of, you know, the understanding comes from the team, right?
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:14,000] You know, like I didn't know anything when I came and then, you know, trips that Ricky and Edward
[00:00:14,000 -> 00:00:20,000] took me around China, you know, talking to my cooks in the kitchen, getting them to taste the food,
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:24,000] getting their feedback, you know, helps me get to a certain point, you know.
[00:00:24,000 -> 00:00:27,000] Have you watched Shijian Shang de Zhongguo?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,919] It's a Chinese documentary.
[00:00:03,919 -> 00:00:04,919] Taste of China?
[00:00:04,919 -> 00:00:05,919] Taste of China.
[00:00:05,919 -> 00:00:06,919] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:06,919 -> 00:00:07,919] Also fascinating.
[00:00:07,919 -> 00:00:08,919] Very fascinating.
[00:00:08,919 -> 00:00:13,599] That's the first Chinese TV show that I feel really emphasized on the local ingredients
[00:00:13,599 -> 00:00:15,320] and the local traditional way of cooking.
[00:00:15,320 -> 00:00:22,000] I think that, yeah, it's really well done, you know, and it really goes into the back
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:23,000] countryside.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,000] You said you chose to do fine dining because the price allows for experimentation.
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:18,079] Yeah, I mean, usually fine dining can eat up a lot of costs that regular restaurants
[00:00:18,079 -> 00:00:21,760] don't have the privilege of.
[00:00:21,760 -> 00:00:28,800] Simple things like just buying nice plates, things like this.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,320] luxury products, you're not limited to the products because whether it's expensive or
[00:00:04,320 -> 00:00:07,719] not you can adjust it in your menu accordingly.
[00:00:07,719 -> 00:00:12,800] People coming already are expecting to pay a high price so they're not surprised.
[00:00:12,800 -> 00:00:18,480] But I guess the trade-off, the biggest trade-off I identify is you have this vision and you
[00:00:18,480 -> 00:00:20,199] want more people.
[00:00:20,199 -> 00:00:21,199] Do you?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,919] I'm guessing you want more people to learn about this concept and, you know,
[00:00:08,000 -> 00:00:10,919] appreciate the ingredients, for example, or
[00:00:12,000 -> 00:00:15,640] agree to this concept. Yeah, I mean it's already happening in China.
[00:00:15,640 -> 00:00:19,800] I've already noticed a difference in three years. The limitation of doing fan danning is
[00:00:20,239 -> 00:00:25,800] influence or impact is limited to, you know, the... I actually disagree. I think it's the opposite.
[00:00:26,519 -> 00:00:28,519] So I think if you have
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,360] you know, let's say a family restaurant, 200 people every night, you know, you're busy,
[00:00:07,360 -> 00:00:13,039] you're usually so busy you can't even step back to really think about, you know, food
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:15,160] in an artistic and expressive way.
[00:00:15,160 -> 00:00:21,199] I think fine dining, doing less covers, you know, it allows, it's in the concept that
[00:00:21,199 -> 00:00:26,480] you need to be spending time on research and development, on thinking, on innovating.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,240] That's part of the equation of that restaurant.
[00:00:03,240 -> 00:00:10,679] And also through the success, if it is successful, then the exposure is much more known.
[00:00:10,679 -> 00:00:11,679] That's true.
[00:00:11,679 -> 00:00:16,039] A local restaurant that's doing 200 a night, yeah, might have its local diners coming there
[00:00:16,039 -> 00:00:19,280] every night, but they're going to be a lot more repeat guests.
[00:00:19,280 -> 00:00:24,399] People are traveling all around the country to come visit us because now we are exposed
[00:00:24,399 -> 00:00:25,559] because we are known.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,839] And then because of that we're doing interviews, you know, we're being exposed right now on
[00:00:04,839 -> 00:00:06,160] the concepts and the philosophy.
[00:00:06,160 -> 00:00:11,199] So I think fine dining puts you at a stage that you influence more people, but maybe
[00:00:11,199 -> 00:00:13,439] less people get to actually experience it.
[00:00:13,439 -> 00:00:14,439] Yeah, okay.
[00:00:14,439 -> 00:00:19,039] Physically, but you know, through, you know, media and stuff, they can experience it at
[00:00:19,039 -> 00:00:23,239] the same, especially in our time, you know, on Instagram, you can check anything anytime,
[00:00:23,239 -> 00:00:26,719] you know, back then you could only experience fine dining if you went there.
[00:00:26,719 -> 00:00:27,719] Yep.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,720] Do you have any Instagram account?
[00:00:03,720 -> 00:00:04,719] I do.
[00:00:04,719 -> 00:00:08,919] I'm not an active Instagrammer that much.
[00:00:08,919 -> 00:00:13,080] I should be, you know, people always tell me I should be more active on social media
[00:00:13,080 -> 00:00:14,080] and stuff.
[00:00:14,080 -> 00:00:20,679] Yeah, if you like it, then sure, but even if you don't like it, maybe it's better for
[00:00:20,679 -> 00:00:21,679] the...
[00:00:21,679 -> 00:00:23,039] I don't know.
[00:00:23,039 -> 00:00:27,800] I like a little bit of secrecy.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,719] But again, on the difference too, I think, so farm to table, the concepts of what make
[00:00:07,719 -> 00:00:13,460] farm to table, which like if you pull it back, the sustainability philosophies or the philosophies
[00:00:13,460 -> 00:00:18,719] about sustainability, those are not necessarily always practiced well.
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:25,480] And it's almost an oxymoron in, which means kind of like two words that mean opposite
[00:00:25,480 -> 00:00:27,920] things in the same sentence, like jumbo shrimp.
[00:00:27,920 -> 00:00:28,920] Shrimps are always small.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,640] But it's jumbo shrimp, that's an oxymoron.
[00:00:02,640 -> 00:00:08,800] So a sustainable fine dining is almost the same in my mind, or farm-to-table fine dining.
[00:00:08,800 -> 00:00:12,439] And the fact that when you do fine dining, you're always picking the most perfect piece,
[00:00:12,439 -> 00:00:14,519] you're wasting a lot of food.
[00:00:14,519 -> 00:00:20,000] And the concept of farm-to-table and sustainability is to do the opposite, right?
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:26,839] And so I think, you know, when you, you know, yes, you can be an all vegan plant-based restaurant,
[00:00:26,839 -> 00:00:28,800] which is very sustainable.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,259] But even if you work with farms and products and you really try to look at it and use up
[00:00:05,259 -> 00:00:09,839] every aspect of that product and that animal, and then that's what comes into our storytelling
[00:00:09,839 -> 00:00:16,059] as well, is that we're presenting something beautiful that looks very calculated and organized,
[00:00:16,059 -> 00:00:20,199] but in reality we're not wasting that much food.
[00:00:20,199 -> 00:00:27,280] And I think that is something special in itself.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:10,400] Other side of this question is, so a lot of the concept can be better expressed in fine dining.
[00:00:10,400 -> 00:00:17,399] So for Nongjia Le, right, the Chinese countryside chef, they cannot do fine dining, right?
[00:00:17,399 -> 00:00:20,500] What requirements does it take?
[00:00:20,500 -> 00:00:23,399] I mean, they can do fine dining.
[00:00:23,399 -> 00:00:26,500] They can, but I don't know if they're going to be successful.
[00:00:26,500 -> 00:00:29,399] Right.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:00,800] So what...
[00:00:00,800 -> 00:00:03,680] So one is the consumer, you know,
[00:00:03,680 -> 00:00:08,560] is someone going to go in the countryside in China to visit this small place to have...
[00:00:09,199 -> 00:00:09,759] Probably not.
[00:00:09,759 -> 00:00:10,960] Probably not, right?
[00:00:10,960 -> 00:00:12,000] But in America, that's...
[00:00:13,039 -> 00:00:17,120] A lot of people get in their car, they go on the weekends,
[00:00:17,120 -> 00:00:24,399] they go into the countryside and they, you know, visit small quaint restaurants.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,000] And so I think that's, you know, something like the Michelin Guide in France.
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:09,000] It's for this purpose.
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:13,000] It's literally for this purpose. A three-star meant you go out, you know, you go out at a two-star,
[00:00:13,000 -> 00:00:17,000] maybe you take a detour, or one-star, you just, if you're in the same city.
[00:00:17,000 -> 00:00:20,000] So people would say, oh, there's a three-star.
[00:00:20,000 -> 00:00:25,000] And like the culture around the Michelin and like people actually trying to discover these restaurants in the countryside.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,000] And then it led to, okay, well, you know, like myself, I'm a chef that wants to be closer to the products.
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:10,000] I'm gonna go open a restaurant in the countryside and do fine dining.
[00:00:10,000 -> 00:00:18,000] And then it's, and I can, you know, if I get three stars within the first five years, then I can be successful, you know, or two stars or one star even.
[00:00:18,000 -> 00:00:23,000] But if you don't get any, you know, accolades, you would rely on your business to be local.
[00:00:23,000 -> 00:00:29,000] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. But that's the different, a different part.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,280] You have the confidence, at least in the possibility of you getting one, two, three star
[00:00:07,799 -> 00:00:11,960] Even if you are in the countryside. Right, but let's say there's no Michelin for you know
[00:00:11,960 -> 00:00:17,480] So you at least need to be confident in your ability to attract someone to take the tour
[00:00:18,039 -> 00:00:21,839] To go and visit your countryside restaurant. So what I'm trying to get is
[00:00:22,679 -> 00:00:25,160] What are the most necessary skills?
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,160] necessary skills for a chef to be successful other than you know emphasize
[00:00:06,160 -> 00:00:12,480] on the ingredients? Well I mean it has to be a good experience. But for the chef?
[00:00:12,480 -> 00:00:17,719] For the chef. The skills of the chef. He has to be a good host. I mean every chef I think
[00:00:17,719 -> 00:00:24,039] has to be a good host but even more so when you're putting the experience out
[00:00:24,039 -> 00:00:27,320] in the countryside. So for example like let's look at some restaurants that I
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:01,800] I think are well known in the countryside.
[00:00:01,800 -> 00:00:04,200] I mean, Blue Hills, 45 minutes away.
[00:00:04,200 -> 00:00:05,400] It's not like completely out.
[00:00:05,400 -> 00:00:06,200] It's not that far.
[00:00:06,200 -> 00:00:07,000] But it is.
[00:00:07,000 -> 00:00:09,119] But you know Faviken?
[00:00:09,119 -> 00:00:11,759] So Faviken used to be, I think it closed down now,
[00:00:11,759 -> 00:00:14,119] it used to be a restaurant five hours away from Stockholm
[00:00:14,119 -> 00:00:17,440] in Sweden in the very north.
[00:00:17,440 -> 00:00:19,160] But it was still popular.
[00:00:19,160 -> 00:00:20,120] Why?
[00:00:20,120 -> 00:00:23,800] Because he still did a good experience,
[00:00:23,800 -> 00:00:25,320] but you go there for the weekend.
[00:00:25,320 -> 00:00:27,760] He has a little place you can sleep.
[00:00:27,760 -> 00:00:29,280] You stay there.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:02,960] you eat a great breakfast.
[00:00:02,960 -> 00:00:08,320] I had an example in mind, but Willow's Inn, but recently it's been criticized.
[00:00:08,320 -> 00:00:10,400] But also, Willow's Inn for a while too, you know.
[00:00:10,400 -> 00:00:11,400] It's a good experience.
[00:00:11,400 -> 00:00:13,720] You still have to go there.
[00:00:13,720 -> 00:00:17,359] And so I think it's not just a restaurant.
[00:00:17,359 -> 00:00:24,679] This restaurant will attract anyone, business dinners, people looking for a special night,
[00:00:24,679 -> 00:00:27,800] birthdays, celebrations, all of that.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,120] But like Meadowood, all of these restaurants in the middle of, you know, it's part of a
[00:00:05,120 -> 00:00:09,000] larger trip, you know, it's part of like, okay, I heard about this restaurant.
[00:00:09,000 -> 00:00:14,880] So I think in the modern time, you have to be good at marketing, social media, these
[00:00:14,880 -> 00:00:19,320] kind of things to at least get people to know that you're out there.
[00:00:19,320 -> 00:00:23,079] I think there's a couple exceptions and I actually, you know, like I worked with a couple
[00:00:23,079 -> 00:00:24,079] of them.
[00:00:24,079 -> 00:00:28,320] Like I said, this farm above Toronto, he didn't really care about accolades or marketing or
[00:00:28,320 -> 00:00:29,359] that much.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:07,299] He just, but he had spent some time in Toronto, so he had created his own kind of clients
[00:00:07,299 -> 00:00:08,460] and you know.
[00:00:08,460 -> 00:00:10,699] Does he innovate a lot?
[00:00:10,699 -> 00:00:13,460] Does he make a lot of new dishes?
[00:00:13,460 -> 00:00:15,699] I didn't see much innovation.
[00:00:15,699 -> 00:00:20,379] Like he had figured, I mean he was, when I worked for him he was already 50, you know,
[00:00:20,379 -> 00:00:24,899] so he's already, you know, at the end of his career he had come to his innovation and I
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:05,160] I think his innovation came more in how he presented the experience, not in necessarily
[00:00:05,160 -> 00:00:06,799] the food.
[00:00:06,799 -> 00:00:12,759] What I mean by that is he had his contacts, he had an email list, and he would do special
[00:00:12,759 -> 00:00:14,880] events using his land.
[00:00:14,880 -> 00:00:20,440] Like a mobile dinner experience where you would go into the field to have one course,
[00:00:20,440 -> 00:00:23,339] over here for the next course.
[00:00:23,339 -> 00:00:26,239] He would send out an email, he would do this once a month.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,960] Of course people go and they have such a unique experience that he creates enough attention
[00:00:04,960 -> 00:00:09,240] that people will go just for the regular dinner, which is just in his farmhouse.
[00:00:09,240 -> 00:00:13,640] So he does special events mixed with his regular experience.
[00:00:13,640 -> 00:00:14,640] How was the food?
[00:00:14,640 -> 00:00:18,719] I mean, the food is good and it's like an eight-course tasting menu.
[00:00:18,719 -> 00:00:19,719] It's very fresh.
[00:00:19,719 -> 00:00:21,079] It's all from the farm.
[00:00:21,079 -> 00:00:26,039] He raises his own pigs, chickens, cattle, vegetables, all that stuff.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,879] People would go for different experiences experiencing the same food and it will still be...
[00:00:04,879 -> 00:00:07,280] I mean the food changes, like the dishes always change.
[00:00:07,280 -> 00:00:12,880] The dishes are always changing but I would say the overall concept of the food doesn't change very much.
[00:00:12,880 -> 00:00:13,880] You know, but like...
[00:00:15,599 -> 00:00:16,800] You know, you look confused.
[00:00:16,800 -> 00:00:17,800] Like it's hard to explain.
[00:00:17,800 -> 00:00:19,079] Like, because...
[00:00:19,079 -> 00:00:24,480] Once you've created the style, you know, the style stays the same.
[00:00:24,480 -> 00:00:25,000] Yeah.
[00:00:25,000 -> 00:00:26,480] But like maybe a few...
[00:00:26,480 -> 00:00:27,239] The combination.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:03,640] Yeah, the combinations are slightly changed depending on the season.
[00:00:03,640 -> 00:00:09,720] It's lamb with carrots, next day it's lamb with turnips, next day it's lamb with potatoes.
[00:00:09,720 -> 00:00:12,800] It's lamb with a vegetable.
[00:00:12,800 -> 00:00:17,239] Maybe it's, because he uses whole animals, first day it's rack, then it's slow-cooked
[00:00:17,239 -> 00:00:21,480] leg, then it's a sausage or terrine.
[00:00:21,480 -> 00:00:25,359] So the ingredients are all kind of the same.
[00:00:25,359 -> 00:00:26,920] The pairings are slightly different.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,519] The reason I look confused is because I thought this is what most restaurants do.
[00:00:04,519 -> 00:00:07,879] I thought they don't change the concept, they change the combination.
[00:00:07,879 -> 00:00:12,599] But from your experience, it seems like a lot of restaurants, actually, their concept
[00:00:12,599 -> 00:00:17,199] is evolving drastically over time.
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:19,760] Depending on what stage of their career they're in, you know.
[00:00:19,760 -> 00:00:21,280] Sometimes they're making dramatic changes.
[00:00:21,280 -> 00:00:24,960] Like if you look at En Sous from our first year to now, I think it's much different.
[00:00:24,960 -> 00:00:28,960] But Meadowood, when I first started, it was very different from when I ended.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,000] But the last three years were very similar, were the same.
[00:00:04,000 -> 00:00:09,160] And partially why I left was because I had seen the cycles of the seasons and I had already,
[00:00:09,160 -> 00:00:12,720] like, oh, now we're doing a cod dish again in early spring.
[00:00:12,720 -> 00:00:17,079] OK, we're going to probably do it with sunflowers for two weeks and then we'll switch to this
[00:00:17,079 -> 00:00:20,120] dip, because we know how things are going.
[00:00:20,120 -> 00:00:21,199] You become efficient.
[00:00:21,199 -> 00:00:22,920] You become more perfect.
[00:00:22,920 -> 00:00:24,800] You've mastered the combinations.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:06,000] But the innovation stage has, you know, the majority of the innovation stage has happened.
[00:00:06,000 -> 00:00:09,619] It's still happening a little bit, but it's not as much as, you know, like when you come
[00:00:09,619 -> 00:00:12,800] to a new country, this is also why I came to China.
[00:00:12,800 -> 00:00:17,199] It's like it's so different, so much changing, so much trying, so much innovation.
[00:00:17,199 -> 00:00:21,000] Maybe also Chinese restaurants, if you notice, the menus don't change very often.
[00:00:21,000 -> 00:00:22,000] Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:22,000 -> 00:00:26,199] Like you find a signature dish and you keep with it, you know.
[00:00:00,000 -> 00:00:04,080] You can have a popular restaurant known on one dish in China.
[00:00:04,080 -> 00:00:08,160] And I think for me that's a very foreign concept.
[00:00:08,160 -> 00:00:09,759] It was also uncomfortable for me.
[00:00:09,759 -> 00:00:10,759] I like change.
[00:00:10,759 -> 00:00:18,039] For me, I have this saying, change is inevitable, but growth is optional.
[00:00:18,039 -> 00:00:22,039] I think it's important that you're always trying to change and grow and become better.
