1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Hey folks, welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,560
Today is a special English episode about why Facebook is such a great place for data scientists

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,800
to work at.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,800
The content of this video is very similar to my Chinese version, so if you have seen

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,480
that video, feel free to skip this one.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,839
But the reason I want to do it in English is because 1.

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:27,559
The knowledge is pretty applicable for English speakers as well. And two, because at the end of this video,

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm going to announce I'm leaving Facebook.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,880
And I want to help my org, my team, to hire my backfill.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,320
So I want to reach out to other English-speaking data

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,439
scientists as well, because you might be

12
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,520
interested after hearing my video.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,359
OK, let's get to it.

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,000
So first of all, about the conclusion,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,439
Facebook is a great place for data scientists to work at.

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,799
I know everyone's opinion is biased, but I try to collect a lot of information

17
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,439
to be as unbiased as possible.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,560
My personal background is, I worked two years at Amazon as an economist

19
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,280
and then moved to Facebook.

20
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:08,159
When I came to Facebook, I was shocked by how important data is in the products.

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,079
So all the products I see at Facebook

22
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,959
starts with data and ends as data.

23
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,519
And as data scientists,

24
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,519
you really have a lot of say in the direction,

25
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,560
strategy, and outcome of these products.

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,040
And people actually listen to you by people,

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,280
I mean, cross-functional partners,

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,620
such as engineers, PMs, product managers, designers,

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,200
researchers, and everyone.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,719
Like, people really respect data.

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,599
And I really believe the work I do at Facebook

32
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,560
as a data scientist creates tremendous value

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,439
for the product.

34
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,439
After this discovery, I start talking to my industry friends

35
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,000
who work at different companies,

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
especially the people who joined Facebook from other companies and people who leave Facebook and went to other companies.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And to my surprise, all the people, whether they came to Facebook from other companies or they left Facebook and went to other companies,

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,599
they recognized the value of data at Facebook and they all believe Facebook is one of the best places

39
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,280
for data scientists to work at.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Immediately we're thinking, okay,

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,800
is it because data scientists at Facebook

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,080
are doing particularly different things?

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,199
Then we realized it's not the case.

44
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,599
In most companies, at least in most tech companies,

45
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,840
we all have good ideas of what data scientists should do

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,039
and what can we bring to the table.

47
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,520
But realities at different companies are very different.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,599
In some companies, people say we want to have

49
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,199
data-driven decisions,

50
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,560
but they actually are just paying lip service.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,759
And they are only using data to confirm their opinions

52
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,819
instead of changing their opinions.

53
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,000
So I went deeper into summarizing

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,719
what's so special at Facebook that makes data effective.

55
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,319
And I summarized three key points.

56
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,159
One is the infrastructure.

57
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,900
Two is the culture.

58
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,280
And three is the organizational structure.

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,960
And hopefully, this will help you establish a framework

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,800
of how Facebook did it.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,439
OK, without further ado, let's start.

62
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,800
First, infrastructure.

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
Speaking of infrastructure, we have to thank our data engineers.

64
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,199
At Facebook, I think the ratio of data scientists to data engineers is 2 to 1.

65
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,960
And data engineers made the life of data scientists so easy.

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,919
When I talk to data scientists at other companies,

67
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,000
depending on the level of infrastructure,

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,919
they often spend 50% to 80% of their time

69
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,439
trying to clean the data,

70
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,759
trying to get the data they actually need

71
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,759
before they can do any analysis.

72
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,080
But at Facebook, we have specialized data engineers.

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,520
We also have a lot of tools for software engineers

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,319
to build the logging and then build the pipeline.

75
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,800
So the data, when we want to analyze, they are right in front of us and in nice format

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,139
in the right size.

77
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:57,719
So all the time that other people have to do to clean the data is saved so we can focus

78
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,919
our, so data scientists can focus our time in analyzing the important questions.

79
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,159
The other side of this infrastructure is the automatic tools are very advanced.

80
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,840
If I want to build a dashboard, I

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,639
can directly do that after running a query.

82
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,280
So if I run a query, I don't need

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,399
to worry about what machines I'm using.

84
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,000
It's all automatic and elastic.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,240
And after I get the results, I can easily share my results,

86
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,839
or I can do quick analysis or data visualization,

87
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:32,000
and I can easily copy paste into a dashboard, and it became automatic. So, one, we can scale our

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,079
impact because it's there, it's automatic, it's visualized, so more people can look at it,

89
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,759
understand it, and change decisions based on the data or based on the analysis. And two,

90
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,000
we get to automate a lot of our work.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A lot of analytics in other companies,

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
their role is basically getting the data

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and support this ad hoc request.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
At Facebook, doing this ad hoc request

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
is really a data scientist's favor

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to the cross-function teams.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They should be able to do most of the ad hoc queries themselves.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
It's not part of our core requirement.

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,519
Our core requirement is to use scientific methods

100
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,920
to analyze a problem, think strategies,

101
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,560
drive the direction of the product,

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,439
and prioritize our team's work.

103
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,360
Needless to say, most of this work

104
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,720
are way more impactful than those ad hoc queries.

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,160
OK, so that is infrastructure.

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,000
To sum up, it saves us a lot of time to get the data, and it also amplifies our impact

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
by making things automatic.

108
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,839
The second thing is about culture.

109
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,759
The reason that Facebook has a very strong data culture, I believe, is because Facebook

110
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,279
has a very strong eng a very strong engineering culture.

111
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:52,079
If you look at big tech companies at Silicon Valley, Facebook and Google are probably the two

112
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:59,920
most engineer-driven companies. But Google moves kind of slowly and Facebook moves much faster.

113
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,000
So at Facebook, a lot of products are very scrappy, and they start almost like a hackathon.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If an engineer has an idea and wants to try,

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
he or she already has the freedom to do so,

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and they can just start the experiment without many permissions,

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
without jumping through many loops.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,040
And then we use data to measure the performance of these experiments and decide which one is better for the users.

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,879
So it's really this edge-driven culture that makes data powerful because this is

120
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,639
kind of a meritocracy, right?

121
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,360
And you have to have a standard to say which one out of your 100 projects

122
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
is more promising and better for the user than you use data to tell.

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
This also ties back to the infrastructure.

124
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,319
At Facebook, A-B testing infrastructure is very advanced and very efficient.

125
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,579
Actually there is a former Facebook VP, Vijay, he started a company called StatSec to try

126
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:08,040
to make Facebook A-B testing infrastructure available to the public. I'm actually going to interview him and his company

127
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,839
in the following weeks.

128
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,600
So stay tuned if you want to know more about this.

129
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,720
But to sum up my previous point,

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,360
Facebook has a very strong data culture

131
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,800
because it has a very strong edge culture.

132
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,120
And to be able to make this meritocracy work,

133
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
be able to hold people accountable,

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,279
we really need to find ways to make data speak and work, be able to hold people accountable. We really need to find

135
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:32,560
ways to make data speak and data scientists be the objective voice. So that helps us to build a very

136
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,160
strong data culture. And because data scientists have a lot of time to think about products,

137
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,439
we also have the ability to do a scientific understanding and a scientific analysis.

138
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,240
We also deal with data all the time, so we probably

139
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,519
know which part of the product is more impactful and easier to drive. So naturally, data scientists

140
00:07:53,519 --> 00:08:01,920
contribute to strategies. Most products start with data, which means we do some analysis pointing out

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,720
a potential opportunity or something that is a gap and we need to fix.

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,680
And then we start working on those and ends with data.

143
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,160
We use all sorts of measurement, including A-B testing

144
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,639
and including other, like such as retention analysis

145
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,040
to say, okay, this is when we reached

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,439
our potential opportunity.

147
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,959
And this is a product that this work

148
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,180
is actually helping our users.

149
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,039
So the culture, data scientist has a lot of say

150
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,139
and a lot of influence in products.

151
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,919
Then the third thing is the org structure,

152
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,600
organizational structure.

153
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,960
At Facebook, the organizational structure

154
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,899
is this centralized but embedded structure. At Facebook, the organizational structure is this centralized but embedded structure.

155
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,899
Centralized means data scientists

156
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,659
report to data scientists and tell where they're at.

157
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:56,799
So for example, at Amazon, engineers, PMs, designers,

158
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,820
data scientists, they all roll up their reporting chain

159
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,659
to a senior manager or to a director.

160
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,200
So they report to the same director.

161
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,240
But at Facebook, your data scientist

162
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,720
reports to data scientist manager,

163
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,080
who report to data scientist director,

164
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,080
and then data scientist director, data scientist VP.

165
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,240
My reporting chain doesn't merge

166
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,440
with an engineer reporting chain until Fiji,

167
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,480
who is the boss of Facebook app.

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,000
And engineers also have their own reporting chain. PMs have their own reporting chain and tell Fiji, who is the boss of Facebook app. And engineers also have their own reporting chain.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,940
PMs have their own reporting chain.

170
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,679
Designers have their own reporting chain.

171
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,000
So this is the centralized part of it.

172
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,720
This allows us to remain independent, right?

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,159
Our credibility really comes from us being neutral.

174
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,399
Like if I report to a senior manager who is also the single-thread owner of this product

175
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:54,600
He or she may not want me to say certain things if their career is tied to the success or failure of this product

176
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,779
I cannot speak ill of this product, but if my reporting chain is

177
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,039
Independent I'm free to say whatever I feel like is objectively true and also best

178
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,100
for the org overall, instead of just best for the career of this particular PM or this

179
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,019
particular engineer manager.

180
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:21,799
And when we have disagreement, I'm free to escalate to my boss and then the bosses can

181
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,440
have their discussions.

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,700
So I don't have to be strong- handed by my cross-functional partners.

183
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,460
I have my own people to back me up.

184
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,980
Meanwhile, I'm also embedded.

185
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:41,679
Embedded means all the cross-functional team get together to work on one product.

186
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,240
So for example, I'm working on the Seller team at Marketplace, and we have

187
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,080
engineers who work on this, we have PMs work on this. I work solely on this product, on this area

188
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:02,080
of the product. So I develop my domain expertise of this product, and I think about this product

189
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,080
all the time. So it gives me this product sense and business sense.

190
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,399
So my analysis is not just pure analysis based on math.

191
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,399
It's based on my understanding of the product and

192
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,720
my desire to solve problems for this product.

193
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,440
So that's the org structure, the centralized plus embedding,

194
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,639
allows us to remain independent, but

195
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,440
also be invested in the products

196
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
and have impact on the product.

197
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
All right, so those are the three reasons I summarized

198
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,440
of why I think data is particularly effective at Facebook.

199
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,399
To balance my opinion, I also try to think about

200
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,480
why Facebook is not a good place

201
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,399
for data scientists to work at. And I found two reasons.

202
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,360
One, especially for junior data scientists, because it's a centralized and embedded model,

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,399
you are the data owner of this product. And your manager cannot help you as much as other companies.

204
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,840
In other companies, it's usually like data is a consultant

205
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,120
role, right? And your manager gets some big projects and he or she can handle you a small

206
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:19,600
piece of it. And your manager would know how to do this. But at Facebook, data scientists have

207
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,159
a lot of autonomy to do things that they believe are best for the product, but because of that,

208
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,519
it also lacks directions and guidance.

209
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,620
You need to figure out what you need to do.

210
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,899
That may not be very productive for junior data scientists.

211
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,440
The second thing is Facebook has been able to attract a lot of great data scientists,

212
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,080
a lot of smart talents.

213
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,919
It works very well when the product is growing very fast,

214
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,860
but in certain areas of the product, it is maybe mature,

215
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,440
or then you will have more people

216
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
than the projects you have,

217
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,960
and then you will have very smart people compete with you

218
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,019
for those high impact projects that can create stress.

219
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,600
It's not my personal experience

220
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,360
because the product I'm working on is in hyper growth

221
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,879
stage. We always have more things to do, but I certainly have heard about this from other people

222
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:16,480
who work on other products. All right, end of the video. This is a recruiting call. If you are

223
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,639
interested in Facebook, the org I'm working in is Marketplace. If you use Facebook, you probably

224
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,519
know Marketplace or use use marketplace. If not,

225
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:34,000
it is a great place for you to sell your stuff. And it is becoming a great place for small

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,480
businesses to start their commerce activities because it's very easy to set up. Like Amazon,

227
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:48,419
we don't charge a lot of seller fees. and there are a lot of buyers coming to marketplace every day trying to find products to purchase.

228
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:50,960
So it's a very promising area.

229
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,460
And because I'm going back to China, we need to hire a backfill for my position.

230
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,600
And the org has a lot of open headcounts.

231
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,360
So I'm going to post the linking of my manager, you feel free to reach out to her and send her a resume.

232
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,919
She'll be more than happy to refer you to a position.

233
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,879
Alright, this is the end of the video.

234
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,879
Hope you enjoyed.

235
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,879
See you next time.

236
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:13,899
Bye.
