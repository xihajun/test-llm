00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello folks, welcome back to my channel.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,719
And today I have the honor to interview with Miles,

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,080
the chef at Insu in Shenzhen.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,240
Hello guys.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,320
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,439
So I just know a little bit about you

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,280
and I just had dinner here yesterday.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,079
It was quite impressive and very unique.

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,920
And I, like personally,

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,000
I felt there is a lot of personalities behind those dishes. And I also read, personally, I felt there is a lot of personalities

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,899
behind those dishes.

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,760
And I also read your article,

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,979
the article about work experience

14
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,719
and a concept about food.

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,619
So I want to do a basic conversation with you

16
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,539
to figure out what's happening.

17
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:44,920
Yeah.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,240
What's going on in my mind.

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,799
So yeah, what's your question then?

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,960
Yeah, so I guess my first one that I've been having,

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,560
like when the dishes were coming to me, right?

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,359
It's about the ingredient.

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,240
And in the article I read,

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,000
you have this concept of Californian Canton Cantonese if I put them all together.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because you didn't like farm-to-table.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Like I don't like the term?

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The term?

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Since it's a marketing gimmick?

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, every restaurant's farm-to-table, even McDonald's.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's true.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Right?

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,280
So I always say that. I think it's farm to table is how every restaurant operates.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,239
I think it's more a deeper philosophy on just connecting where your food is coming from so

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,719
that you kind of understand a little bit more who's growing the food, how it's grown, and

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,680
who's growing the food, how it's grown, and choosing, making choices that I think are

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,599
better for the planet, better for flavor, better socially, so that the whole supply

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,420
chain and where your food is coming from is a thoughtful process. And so I think when people say farm to table, usually in America, it's like, you know,

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,020
you know the farmers that are producing the food.

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,139
That's where the term comes from.

43
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,020
And here it's a little bit more complicated in China.

44
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,740
So that's interesting.

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,979
Yeah, it's not.

46
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:26,659
It was actually kind of because I most of my experiences in farm to table, farm to table, but it was, you know,

47
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,960
to quite an extremes, you know,

48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,780
in Canada I worked at one restaurant that every, we lived on the farm,

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,419
we grew our own food. Which one was that? Eigginson Farm.

50
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:41,379
Eigginson Farm. Yeah, it's above Toronto, about two hours north in Toronto in the

51
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,219
countryside,

52
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:45,199
and, you know, it had, it was a chef that doesn't really care so much about accolades, but two hours north in Toronto in the countryside.

53
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,680
It was a chef that doesn't really care so much about accolades, but at one time he was

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,159
number ninth in the San Pellegrino, world's best restaurants, right around the time Al

55
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,680
Buli and stuff was popular.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,120
I think he's been doing the same thing.

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,960
Before it was a fad and after it became less popular,

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,479
he's always been doing this, you know, farm to table, this connection to the land.

59
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,719
I just realized we have those kind of restaurants here.

60
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,719
Exactly.

61
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,719
They're called Nongjia Le.

62
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,719
Really?

63
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:22,080
You go to the countryside and they have like villagers set up a local restaurant.

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,639
And of course, the chicken is raised right in the backyard.

65
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,139
Right, right, right. Yeah. And I think, you know, I mean, that's normal. raised right in the backyard. Right, right, right.

66
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,580
And I think that's normal, that's how it used to be, right?

67
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,479
And then the modern media kind of like, we were away from that.

68
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,439
I don't think it's the fault of modern media, it's the fault of modern industry, right?

69
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,280
The food, especially in North America, is so industrialized.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
And yeah, a lot of stuff is processed

71
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
and heavily modified.

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,620
Yeah.

73
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,840
I mean, also people live in cities now.

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,360
Like Shenzhen 30 years ago was just farmland.

75
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,599
And now when you eat food, you don't

76
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,879
know where it's coming from.

77
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,680
And so I think there was a movement 10, 15 years ago in North America

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
that people started to say,

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,599
well, where does the people living in the cities,

80
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,319
where does my food come from?

81
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,599
And so they started to adventure.

82
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,519
I think these restaurants that became popular at this time

83
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,000
were just doing the same thing.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,519
I already have so many questions following up that.

85
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,680
I think I'll try to do three questions following this topic.

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,680
One, what's the difference between the United States, which is a developed world, people

87
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,240
have been through the industrialized process and now try to get back to nature, be more

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,519
self-conscious and environmental conscious.

89
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,959
How is the trend in China, your experience?

90
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,319
Because we've gone through a different path.

91
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,240
Yeah.

92
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,759
And the second is, there are so many layers

93
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,839
in this concept, right?

94
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,839
First is being, knowing the food,

95
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,779
knowing how it's produced,

96
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:01,120
but from that concept to a fine dining restaurant,

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
there are also other things.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
Right.

99
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,879
So what are the other things?

100
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,279
That's two questions. Let's start with the two. Because of the

101
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:17,079
third one I actually prepared for later. So the first part is the difference between

102
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:27,560
I think China and America. And I think, like you you know, there's these restaurants already in China and I think,

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,920
you know, China's gone through this very rapid industrialization.

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:42,600
And now I find a lot of culture in China is kind of, it's not copying, it's like, like

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,680
branding means a lot of, to a lot of people in China.

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,079
And so when something becomes cool in America, like from the table...

107
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,879
I was thinking about Applebee's, Chiskefection.

108
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,920
Yeah, or Gucci, or you know, there's a ride of brand.

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,319
But I mean, the concept of, you know, let's say like social media in America, Instagram

110
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,319
is used a lot, right?

111
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,480
So you know, people go to, you know, avocado toast, yeah, avocado toast, taking picture

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,920
of their food, going to the farm, showing like farm day, hashtag, you know, all these

113
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,319
things.

114
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,339
Then the same kind of things are mimicked here in China.

115
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,000
But when I try to experience these things, that experience is very curated.

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Meaning that it becomes a tourist kind of trap.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's not a trap, it's just they've calculated every aspect of it.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So you get on a bus, you go to a campsite, and there's a picture spot, the tents are all perfect,

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,240
there's heaters in the thing. It's like a very curated experience. And this, you know, this extends to, I think,

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,879
like picturesque farms, you know. So if, you know, for example, like the

121
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,759
sunflower chicken, I don't know if you know this, sunflower chicken, is, I know

122
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,759
now it's like a, you know, it's not, they don't even do it anymore, but, you know,

123
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,720
five years ago, he, you ago, he started feeding his chicken

124
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,759
sunflowers, and it's super delicious.

125
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,959
Became super popular.

126
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,319
And then, G. Ron G. starts running Sunflower Chicken.

127
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,000
The price goes way up, because the farmer can charge that.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,160
And then he starts, people can go there.

129
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,879
And then it's a sunflower fields, and there's special

130
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,000
paths, and he serves the sunflower chicken.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,040
And he's making lots and lots of money off this process. It's no longer about you know

132
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,879
let's you know let's feed the chicken or let's do something different with food

133
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:38,759
it's become a tourist money-making endeavor. I follow Dan Barber's

134
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:47,000
Instagram a lot. He does a lot of this processing, experimenting, but he doesn't turn that into a tourist activity.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,839
But I mean, even like Blue Hill is successful, and it is a visitor center, and you go there

136
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,560
and you see all of the farming and all that stuff. You know, I haven't been to Blue Hill

137
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,680
in a very long time, but when I was looking for a job in America, I I had two places in mind Meadowood and

138
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,800
Blue Hill and I went to visit both of them and

139
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,600
you know because I had come from this farm in Canada, I like I were and

140
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,399
And so like I'd end up not choosing Blue Hill, I didn't choose Blue Hill because I did feel that

141
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,379
they had curated the experience for their

142
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,080
diners, almost like they're trying too hard.

143
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
And I know it's one of your favorite restaurants.

144
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,460
I do agree with the curation part.

145
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,279
The way I describe my experience at Blue Hill is almost like a theater.

146
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
It's not only about food, it's also about the presentation,

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,100
the whole behind the thing.

148
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,899
So they take you to different, you know,

149
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,200
this is our grill, this is how we make the bread.

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,299
This is our compost, look how we cook things in the compost.

151
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,799
But I do think it's, like, I enjoy the education

152
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,600
because I'm not used to the whole concept.

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,240
And a lot of presentation over there

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,919
is the first thing I ever get educated on this concept,

155
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,120
and I became more environmental conscious after the dinner.

156
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,759
So I welcome that.

157
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,799
Yeah, and I think they're doing it.

158
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,840
And because of that reason, it's amazing, right?

159
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,080
Because it's the person that doesn't know becomes educated, and then

160
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,399
they know. And I think, of course, you need this, because we need to teach more people.

161
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,460
But from a personal experience, when I had already known, and I already had a lot of

162
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,080
experience in these things, I felt like it was a little bit fake, you know, it wasn't

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,000
authentic in its deliverance.

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,399
99% attention on food and the rest of the stuff comes naturally.

165
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,799
It's more, let's center our food around the presentation.

166
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,299
Right, the presentation of these sustainable concepts.

167
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:56,799
Yeah.

168
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,299
And like I said, it's all very important.

169
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:06,679
The other thing I noticed in your dishes, I feel like you were almost holding back.

170
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,679
Of course.

171
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,159
Yeah, you are holding back.

172
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,440
This isn't me.

173
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,320
Like I said, I'm the guy who will be in the garden first and who will be trying to, you

174
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,100
know, like tasting things in the garden.

175
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,960
You notice that nothing is predictable in nature.

176
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
Nothing is consistent.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,279
You might have an amazing carrot one year and not the amazing carrot the next year.

178
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,679
And you know, the weather is always changing.

179
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,679
Things are always contributing this.

180
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:40,919
If you can have a restaurant, like my dream restaurant is a restaurant that can change

181
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:48,799
and adapt to nature at any given moment. So, so that you're always getting very interesting amazing products

182
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:56,440
Yeah, it's not necessarily reality, you know this so my story rest restaurant. The third one is central

183
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,799
Yeah, and when I described to a D I told him the food is almost unpleasant

184
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,000
Right because the flavor is so raw and unnatural.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But I still like the experience because it gives you the experience of nature in its most natural form.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Did you have a vegetarian or?

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No.

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay.

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I haven't been to Central, but he came to do a dinner at Meadowood when I was working there.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,879
And I mean, sometimes it's hard to transplant a place like that out of the country and into...

191
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,759
It's impossible.

192
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:41,440
So, you know, like his food was very colorful and, I mean, it was beautiful, but obviously

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:50,039
you need to be in that place, that sense of place to get the experience. Only recently I started to appreciate the natural flavor of food.

194
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,799
Before I was like, this is good, this one tastes good, that one tastes bad.

195
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,320
But now it's more like this one tastes natural and that one tastes artificial.

196
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,759
Right, right, right.

197
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:07,000
I think, yeah, that's, as, you know, chefs develop, they always, you know, they start off, they always want to add so many things.

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,500
Yeah.

199
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,000
And by the end of their career, it's very simple and natural process.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But you are very young.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:25,279
Yeah. I got a lucky early education, you know, like I said, when you're in, you're immersed in the food as it's growing and you're tasting the first buds of a flower, the final flower,

202
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,759
the fruit of the flower, the branches of the tree.

203
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,240
You can taste one plant, one product in many different stages through its life cycle in

204
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
nature.

205
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,759
And then each one of those can add a different flavor, sweet, bitter, you know, spacious.

206
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,000
But as people get more disconnected from nature as a natural tendency,

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
more and more people are living in the city,

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and even if they want to get close to nature,

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
they have to visit a touristy farm,

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and there is no way of them knowing how frustrating it is

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
to try to present the natural flavor to people,

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
because many people may not...

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,879
They have their own standard which is a trend in this brandy industrial process. They

214
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,039
don't actually appreciate what you try to do. Yeah, I mean here I can't even do

215
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,120
it to the full extent. I can do just a small bit of what I know and how

216
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,000
I was trained and grew up in the industry.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,559
But I try to, you know, I have to balance it here.

218
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,600
Like you said, I was holding back.

219
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,919
You know, we have guests that have the expectation as a Western restaurant that they should be

220
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,059
getting luxury Western imported products.

221
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:47,000
And when we deliver Chinese products, some of our clients are, you know, displeased.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This was more so at the beginning.

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I've noticed that they're more accepting now, especially with the pandemic borders being closed.

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I think more people are looking in and actually accept that we're using local ingredients.

225
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,159
And I've noticed the shift in our guests here at the restaurant.

226
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,639
At first there was a lot of complaints about why...

227
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,679
Is it about...

228
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,440
Do you feel it's the same group of people changing their minds

229
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,600
or different group of people?

230
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Maybe 50-50.

231
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,519
Maybe like the people that weren't happy

232
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,960
because we didn't have important ingredients didn't come back,

233
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,440
but the ones that did come back have now accepted us.

234
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I found this to be very...

235
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
That's actually my third question, by the way.

236
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
My third question is the rare of...

237
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,940
Like, the quality of ingredient, what is important?

238
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,440
Because in a lot of Thai and Chinese restaurants,

239
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,940
they stress on the rarity?

240
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,559
Like, the rarity of the ingredients.

241
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,000
This is the king crab from Alaska.

242
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,639
This is the fish, the big yellow fish from the Eastern Sea.

243
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,440
And they charge you a high price.

244
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,159
And that's what people in that kind of fine dining expect. But here you stress on,

245
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:13,759
you emphasize on the source or the story behind the ingredients.

246
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,139
Right. I mean, it's still the same.

247
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:23,720
It's like the yellow croaker from the East China Sea was a fish that was a poor person's fish.

248
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,120
But then it got overfished and then it became so rare that it became a poor person's fish. But then it got overfished, and then it became so rare

249
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,799
that it became a rich person's fish.

250
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,120
You know, it's kind of funny that that story, you know,

251
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,980
had its, but even when they catch it,

252
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,240
I know that story because when I ate it,

253
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,120
Yellow Croaker in Girondrie, and he said,

254
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,080
this is a wild Yellow Croaker, here's the story behind it.

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,879
I was like, okay, so even a luxury product,

256
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,740
whether it is, they're always telling you a story

257
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,100
because they're trying to validate the price

258
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,700
with the story.

259
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,779
And so I need to give the perception of value

260
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:57,259
no matter what.

261
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,100
And it's me balancing so that I'm giving you

262
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,000
the perception of value, but also I'm giving you

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,960
the story of the inspiration because that's

264
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,120
where the value comes from.

265
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:18,620
It's like we're trying to change the perception of the Chinese consumer that you have just

266
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,919
as many beautiful products in this country.

267
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,919
Of course.

268
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,240
And not everyone agrees with us, and we won't change everyone's mind.

269
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,360
But that's our goal, right?

270
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,120
And even then, if I go eat at one of the Japanese restaurants

271
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,240
here, it's the same thing.

272
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,639
They tell me about all of these Japanese products

273
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,320
and how expensive they are and where they are.

274
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,039
And I think in America, you wouldn't have that.

275
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,740
You wouldn't have that storytelling

276
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,159
as it pertains to the value of something. Especially you would never tell the dollar

277
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,480
amount. Some of the Japanese restaurants, they're telling me it cost us this much,

278
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,840
it cost us this much. I'm like, why are you telling me that? It's shocking. But I think

279
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,960
for the Chinese consumer it's important. They need to be able to validate the spending.

280
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,599
Yeah, exactly.

281
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,759
Probably sometimes to their guests as well.

282
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,119
You know, I treated you...

283
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,680
I think it's also a subtle, I don't know tradition,

284
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,000
but concept in our minds that food has magical power, healing power.

285
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So for example, if you eat ginseng,

286
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
it can heal you from, you know,

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
desperate, desperate diseases.

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So we always associate expensive foods with this magical power.

289
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So if we eat something very expensive,

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,720
it is super good to our body.

291
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,200
Not only the taste, it's also like you, yeah. But it probably came in the other way around first,

292
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,400
like probably because, I mean, China has a strong history, a long history, and then certain foods

293
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,960
were known to be of benefit. And then because of that they had more demand, and

294
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,720
because of more demand, then they can increase the price.

295
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,200
And so medicinal products start to get extremely expensive.

296
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,119
Yeah, I think it's also 50-50, right?

297
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:23,160
Expensive food is better for our body, but also then you start to believe the goodness

298
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,319
you ingest from the food is associated with the

299
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,880
price of the food.

300
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,359
So that's kind of the first question, right?

301
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,599
How different it is in the United States and here.

302
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, a compromise that I don't like is doing something for the guests to make them happy, that I know...

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
To feed their ego.

304
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, to feed their ego, that I think compromises on our philosophy.
