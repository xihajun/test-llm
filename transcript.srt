1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
You are one of the most successful and popular Maven instructor.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,279
Your course is $900 and you have another executive course that is $2,500.

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,279
So everything you share is actually highly valuable

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,439
and probably people need to pay money to listen to this.

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,879
And before you were doing this Maven course,

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,079
you were Amazon VP leading, I believe, more than 800 people

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,920
and you wrote a sentence, a very important sentence

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,440
in the Amazon Leadership Principle.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,199
All of those things are true.

10
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:01,560
Yeah.

11
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,219
Some things about work of course, change with time.

12
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,719
Some things will never change.

13
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:12,000
Uh, meaning as long as we're still working with people, um, human nature,

14
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:15,060
uh, hasn't changed a lot.

15
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,660
Some technical experts are building monuments to their own expertise.

16
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,480
They're focused on, is this an elegant algorithm?

17
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,420
Am I solving the hardest problem?

18
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,160
Am I using the newest technology?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
But that doesn't actually necessarily help the business progress.

20
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right.

21
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,679
So I sent you the agenda, but I think this is how I think can be most helpful to the

22
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,119
audience of my channel.

23
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,600
There are two challenges that I sense a lot of people face.

24
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,879
First, are the experiences we hear from successful leaders like you are still relevant in today's

25
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,879
age?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,799
especially, you know, there are less opportunities in the tech industry is growing slower. That's the perception

27
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,599
So like people feel okay. I hear a lot of a lot from

28
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,859
Gurus or the collective coach that speak to their experience, but not necessarily to my experience

29
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,359
Because there are so much fewer opportunities

30
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,399
so that is kind of problem number one and problem number two is many people do not

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
enjoy their work.

32
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,280
I feel the sense is like,

33
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,040
well, I guess a little bit about myself.

34
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,259
I graduated 2017 from Cornell as a Econ PhD

35
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:13,800
and then joined Amazon for two years.

36
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,679
So 2017 to 2019 as an economist.

37
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,719
And then moved to Meta as a data scientist for two years.

38
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,320
Went back to China, joined Tencent,

39
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,280
Tencent Games for two years,

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
vice director for data science and manage 30 people.

41
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,240
But I share this feeling with many people

42
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,820
that before the pandemic, before 2019 especially,

43
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,719
people like to enjoy their work.

44
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,500
And the morale, the vibe is pretty good.

45
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,019
Office is a place that energizes you.

46
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,440
But after pandemic, especially with hybrid working

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
and the slowdown, the layoffs,

48
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,580
many people start to feel stuck in their work

49
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,279
and do not enjoy going to work anymore.

50
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,460
So that's kind of the two overarching problem.

51
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,460
And I know you must have so many experiences in this.

52
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,039
I think, I don't know if we should do a quick introduction,

53
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,879
if I should do a quick introduction about you

54
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,780
and then you can.

55
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,079
Yeah, it's empty.

56
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,480
I mean, I love those topics.

57
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,739
I'm happy to talk about them.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
I do have strong opinions about them.

59
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,679
As for an introduction,

60
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:10,240
that's for what you feel helps your channel most.

61
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,880
So I knew you through Mevan and LinkedIn,

62
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,399
and you are one of the most successful

63
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,640
and popular Mevan instructor.

64
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,239
So, and your course is, I believe is $900,

65
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,899
and you have another executive course that is 2,500.

66
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,879
So everything you share is actually highly valuable,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
and probably people need to pay money to listen to this.

68
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,639
And before you were doing this Maven course,

69
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,839
you were Amazon VP leading, I believe, more than 800 people

70
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,679
and you wrote a sentence, very important sentence

71
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,199
in the Amazon leadership principle.

72
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,359
All of those things are true.

73
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,359
Yeah, I worked 15 years at Amazon from 2005 to 2020,

74
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,199
probably best known there for helping start Prime Video

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
and then also helping start Prime Gaming.

76
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,519
And I spent 12 years in startups before that though.

77
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,800
So I also have startup experience,

78
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,019
albeit kind of one generation back.

79
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,239
And now I work for myself, teaching others what I learned.

80
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
Cool.

81
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,559
Yeah, we have learnings from successful people,

82
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,879
but do those learnings still apply

83
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,879
to today's working environment or today's challenges?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Yeah, so that's of course a hugely broad question.

85
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,360
And if you, after I say a little bit about it,

86
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,160
if you want to specialize or follow up, I invite you to.

87
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,519
But some things about work, of course, change with time.

88
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,600
Some things will never change.

89
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,219
Meaning, as long as we're still working with people,

90
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,079
human nature hasn't changed.

91
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,539
A lot of things about how to work well with people

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
maybe now called emotional intelligence,

93
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,000
I find you can find references to them

94
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,179
in the ancient wisdom

95
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,820
of any of the great world religions, for example.

96
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,119
So I often will find myself

97
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,579
quoting long dead scholars on how to interact with people.

98
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,199
So something as an example,

99
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,940
since you talk about a Chinese audience

100
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,920
that comes, I believe, from Lao Tzu,

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
is the master does the non-doing and everything falls into place,

102
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:11,880
there is a lesson to be drawn today still from that.

103
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,839
Of course, people also focus on learnings from the art of war

104
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,440
and other ancient masters of how things work.

105
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,239
So I think human interaction, there's plenty to be learned,

106
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,480
not just from leaders my age who are still alive,

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,259
but also from historical leaders.

108
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,559
If anything has changed.

109
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,400
Yeah, go ahead.

110
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,240
Oh, sorry.

111
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,000
I was gonna say, so the tactics changed,

112
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,919
but the wisdom is the same wisdom,

113
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,199
but people need to learn the wisdom.

114
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,600
You need, yeah, you need to figure out how to apply those.

115
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,600
So for example, obviously most of those leaders,

116
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,879
any place in the world,

117
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,699
grew up in a time of face-to-face communication.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
now we have hybrid distributed workforces,

119
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,960
that's a little bit different.

120
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,300
And so you have to think about how do you apply this wisdom

121
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,839
maybe in a hybrid environment?

122
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,439
You know, obviously if we think of Sun Tzu

123
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,559
who wrote Art of War,

124
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,280
he wasn't thinking about time zones, right?

125
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,000
He didn't have this like follow the sun model, you know?

126
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,920
So we have some new problems,

127
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,300
but to answer your fundamental root question,

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,560
I don't think building relationships and coordinating groups of people has fundamentally changed.

129
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:22,480
The challenge of organizing a group of people to get something done remains largely similar.

130
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,679
Definitely some of the tools and tactics need to evolve.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
It's very interesting, not because what's changed

132
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,059
was not changed, but because what you think

133
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:11,339
the crux of the problem is, you summarize

134
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,500
as managing a relationship and coordinating people.

135
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,219
But when I think about this, I was especially trying

136
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,339
to emphasize with a lot of IC or land managers,

137
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,500
like staff level IC, senior level IC,

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,799
they will think there are not many promotion opportunities.

139
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,320
So they don't think about these people

140
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,640
or they don't think people is the important part.

141
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,759
As long as I do the job well,

142
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,400
or I have a high scope project,

143
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,800
or I have a certain domain,

144
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,219
I have certain opportunities, I get promoted.

145
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,420
But seems like you feel the other part

146
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,280
is the more important aspect of this.

147
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,559
Well, it's not surprising

148
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,519
because I went into personnel leadership very early.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I did, once I left graduate school,

150
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,620
I was an IC for less than one year

151
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,980
before going into management for the rest of my career.

152
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,480
So it's not surprising I emphasize that.

153
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,239
But one thing I find ICs make a mistake,

154
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,260
there are limited promotion opportunities,

155
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,179
but there are not none.

156
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:28,059
And ICs make a mistake, which is they think

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
that hard work and technical expertise are the only things required.

158
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:14,839
And in fact, the people making decisions about promotions and who gets those opportunities,

159
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,440
usually number one, there's a lot of people who have at least technical competence,

160
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:28,760
meaning several people may be good technically or with their skills

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
or have a good scope project.

162
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,480
So having a little bit better skill

163
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,480
may not be enough to set you apart

164
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
versus having a good working relationship with the manager,

165
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
having shown that you can add value,

166
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,960
not just by your technical skill,

167
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,199
but by your ability to relate that technical skill

168
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,600
to business value makes a big difference

169
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,820
because as an engineer,

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
And as someone who led a lot of engineers,

171
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,519
some technical experts are building monuments

172
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:07,879
to their own expertise.

173
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,080
They're focused on, is this an elegant algorithm?

174
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,640
Am I solving the hardest problem?

175
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,679
Am I using the newest technology?

176
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,879
But that doesn't actually necessarily

177
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,679
help the business progress.

178
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,480
In other words, a working hack and an elegant algorithm

179
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,399
may have the same business value.

180
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,199
Some people are stuck in the mindset,

181
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,260
but I've done better work if I came up

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
with an elegant algorithm?

183
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,960
Well, maybe, but it's not necessarily

184
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,400
going to be tied to promotion.

185
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:17,760
So even for ICs, I often coach ICs that to move up,

186
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,079
you need to think beyond personal technical performance

187
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,120
or even scope of the project.

188
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,160
Because so much of it is trust, relationship,

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
and ability to relate your technology to business value.

190
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,960
Yeah, and there are other guests on my channel

191
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,839
that spoke the same message.

192
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,419
But I find like people,

193
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,879
like there are of course people start paying attention,

194
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,780
but it's hard to do for some reason,

195
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,760
or maybe it's uncomfortable to do.

196
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,140
So like you put, like you raise the awareness

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,799
that you need to pay attention to the business value,

198
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,360
you need to pay attention to connections, relationship.

199
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,240
But then there is no textbook, there is no right or wrong.

200
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,539
Like if you have an elegant algorithm,

201
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,039
you know it's elegant, the code is there.

202
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,160
But then, and do other things,

203
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,280
you'll enter the domain of uncertainty.

204
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,600
I think the uncertainty is the painful part.

205
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,960
Is there a way to help you guide through the uncertainty

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
and kind of have at least a feedback loop of knowing,

207
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,280
am I doing right or wrong?

208
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,240
Because there are so many factors.

209
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,800
Yeah, so I'm going to answer your question,

210
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,439
but with a little bit of background first.

211
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,920
I think our school system creates some of the behavior.

212
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,440
Because if you think about, everyone began in school.

213
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,480
And school has very clear assignments,

214
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,039
and you get grades on them.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
and you're taught that there's a right and wrong

216
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,960
and higher marks are better.

217
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,519
And all of that encourages a push towards

218
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,279
the sort of measurable scientific or pseudoscientific,

219
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,439
but the firmly measured.

220
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,640
And we get good at that.

221
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Everyone at a top company has gone to a good school

222
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,719
and they've striven, they've worked hard to get top marks.

223
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,960
So they're very skilled at that

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
because actually they started training and doing it

225
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,400
maybe as young as five, but definitely at 10 years old,

226
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,759
12 years old, 15 years old, and they have years of training.

227
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,419
When you move to this fuzzy domain, they have no training.

228
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,560
And it's very uncomfortable

229
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,699
because it may be uncomfortable for their personality,

230
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,399
but it's also unfamiliar.

231
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,500
So then your question is, how do you persist in doing it?

232
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,460
Or maybe how do you measure it?

233
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:26,760
I don't know if there's a good way

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,099
to like convert relationship to a measurement.

235
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,679
But there, I mean, you've asked a really good question.

236
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,539
How do you take this fuzzy area and know how you're doing?

237
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:21,019
And the feedback signals are very soft.

238
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,019
They, the feedback signals come in the form,

239
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,559
they come informally of someone telling you

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
that was helpful or that's a good idea

241
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,000
or could you advise us on this project?

242
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,560
One of the ways I have said that senior ICs

243
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,800
can know they're influential

244
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,359
is when is their opinion being sought out

245
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,140
when it's not their project?

246
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,239
In other words, is someone coming to ask you about your,

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ask for your opinion when it's not your work.

248
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,400
That's a huge sign of influence,

249
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,000
is we'd like your advice because you're a good advisor.

250
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,359
Now, how do you get there?

251
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,439
That's a different question.

252
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,839
But if you're being asked to give your input

253
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,320
on things outside your direct work,

254
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,960
the more you're being asked to do that,

255
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,000
the more you've succeeded in being influential

256
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,699
and valuable to the business.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Nice.
