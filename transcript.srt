1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
looking for in a senior engineer is can they explain what they're doing to someone less

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,539
technical? And are they willing to do that? Right? Are they eager or are they resistant?

3
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,940
Do they want to participate in the leadership process? Because when I'm promoting, say,

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,440
someone to principal engineer, I need that person to do two fundamental tasks for me

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that are new, I need them to be able to advise me on decisions I need to make.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,259
And I need to be able to trust their advice, which means they need to be right,

7
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:15,199
that's technical ability, but they also need to be able to communicate it to me

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,640
when I know less than they do about their domain. The second thing is

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,839
principal engineers or staff engineers, very senior ICs, are often used as a

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
as a leader's proxy or ambassador.

11
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,940
So I wanna be able to send my principal engineer

12
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,900
to the principal engineer for another division

13
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,359
and have them represent what we're trying to do

14
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,120
and influence that person.

15
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,260
Because often if I go talk to my peer, another VP,

16
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,839
that VP says, well, maybe we could do that.

17
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,800
What does my PE say?

18
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,620
What does my advisor say?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
And so I need to be able to send my advisor to their advisor.

20
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,879
And picking senior engineers, it does matter

21
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,800
that my advisor has the technical skill to be right,

22
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,679
but it also matters that they have the social skill

23
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,679
to go talk to the other engineer and convince them.

24
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,120
And of course, sometimes it happens

25
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,559
that when my principal engineer

26
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,039
talks to their principal engineer,

27
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,559
actually their principal engineer

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
convinces my principal engineer to change his mind,

29
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,339
which can be okay,

30
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,199
but then I need someone who can come back to me and say,

31
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,279
I talked to that group,

32
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,079
actually the plan we had isn't the best, Ethan,

33
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,760
we should change our plan to be this.

34
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,719
I need someone who can carry that message

35
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,440
and explain it to me in a way that I feel good about it.

36
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,280
Right, that I feel like, oh, okay, we learned something

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
and changing our plan is a good decision,

38
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:06,500
as opposed to me thinking, for example, like, oh, maybe

39
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
you just lost the negotiation.

40
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,519
Right?

41
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,160
Yeah.

42
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,039
And so when I'm deciding who to promote,

43
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,960
I'm looking for those skills.

44
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,660
All of these skills have to do with not just building

45
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,980
technology, but your ability to explain it, understand it

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and context and influence others.

47
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,000
And there's no escaping this.
