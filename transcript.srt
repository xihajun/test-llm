1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
I think it's important that you're always trying to, you know, change and grow and become

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,679
Yeah, for me, I like to order different stuff. I always go for the

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,960
For the dish that I haven't tried before

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,859
So I don't like exactly yeah, even for wine like even I know I like this wine a lot

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,519
I always want to try a different bottle and would you say

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,899
This is abnormal in China or maybe you're influenced from America or

7
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,980
is this just your personality in general?

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,980
I don't know.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,420
Maybe it's the 88 kids, you know?

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,420
Maybe.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,219
AD, what about you?

12
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,460
Do you like to try new stuff?

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,939
I always like to try new stuff.

14
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,380
He's spent a lot of time traveling as well.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,000
For example, last night my favorite dish was the asparagus because it was new.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Really?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What about your friends?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Everyone likes to try new stuff.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,799
They don't like to taste the same food over and over again.

21
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:03,799
So the one signature dish or several signature dishes that neverâ€¦

22
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,359
The signature dish is a different story.

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,359
If it's really good, and it's really associated with the restaurant,

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,359
they would want to taste it when they're here.

25
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,359
But would they go back to taste it again?

26
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:20,359
Yeah. But not with the exact same menu as before.

27
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,359
One signature dish and different combinations.

28
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,519
So maybe that's our way of doing pairing.

29
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,200
Maybe that's also our way of why we like control.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Because for people who are very aesthetic in ordering Chinese food, the ordering is

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:51,120
part of the creation. The way, how you order different dishes, how you choose to combine them, and also the sequence

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,879
of presenting the food is very essential to the whole experience.

33
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:03,799
And someone who knows how to order would have a very different effect.

34
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,680
In our restaurant, we also choose for them.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,919
For example, we make sure when they come next time,

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,240
they don't have the exact same menu as last time.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
But we just choose for them.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,599
Yeah, but I think, and this is what kind of AdWord

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,840
enlightened me to the local preferences,

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,360
is that we can change some, and you can choose some dishes

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,000
for them, but they also need to have some choice.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's why we have these supplements now.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I offer the signature dish as an option, but I never put it on the main menu.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What's the signature dish?

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The chicken. It's not mine.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, yeah, the hot chicken.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sourdough.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,159
Yeah, so if guests come and they love the signature dish,

49
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,159
or they want to show it to a friend or something,

50
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,840
they can order it.

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
But the menu doesn't have that anymore.

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,039
Because I was getting sick of cooking the same thing.

53
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,639
I wanted to keep trying new stuff.

54
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,560
Yeah, I think it's actually a good balance.

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,479
It's not on the menu.

56
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:10,000
It's actually a good balance. It's not on the menu, it's still available. So only people who, you know, people would even, the people who order this dish for the

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
privileged experience would even feel more, even more privileged.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right, right. Exactly.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In the know.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:31,080
There was one question prepared before, and I think it's time to ask that question. Because you are a foreigner coming to China to do Chinese food.

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
I don't say Chinese food.

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Am I doing Chinese food?

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,400
You always said last night you were doing Cantonese food.

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,039
No, no, that's from the article.

67
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,159
The article says you are more than Cantonese and you agreed to the term because you didn't

68
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,000
like the word fusion. I didn't create that word.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Some guests that come in say,

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
oh, you're kind of like a modern Cantonese restaurant.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And when guests tell me that,

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I like it. I like it much more than,

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
oh, I like your fusion concepts.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, me too.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think it's kind of cool because it's...

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Only that I don't view it as modern Cantonese, I view it as modern Chinese.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And the reason I say that is because you use Chinese ingredients, you use Chinese seasoning,

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
maybe not the traditional Chinese seasoning, but you know, the ingredients are from here, of course.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,839
Yeah, it is Chinese food technically, you know.

81
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,879
Chinese food, maybe not Chinese cooking.

82
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,399
Yeah, cuisine.

83
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,480
Cuisine, yeah.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,519
I mean, even that's in the evolution.

85
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,240
Before, I think we were a little bit more closer

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,720
to the palate of Cantonese.

87
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,040
But because Shenzhen has so many different people

88
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
from all over China,

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
it was such a... I would get a complaint that it's not spicy enough,

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
or we didn't use enough bread, or we didn't do this, or you know.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And so I had to kind of open the experience to more than just, you know, Cantonese.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I'm from Yantai.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,639
Same place as the Wagyu beef is from. The Wagyu dish is also from Yantai, the same place as the Wagyu beef is from.

95
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,839
The Wagyu dish is also from Yantai.

96
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,420
Our style is Lu Cai.

97
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:18,160
And there are actually two styles of Lu Cai, which means Shannonese food.

98
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,199
One is the western, more inland, a lot of sauce and soy sauce.

99
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,759
Yeah.

100
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,160
In the western part, in the eastern part,

101
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,519
it's a lot of seafood.

102
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,879
The fish I had yesterday reminds me of that kind of stuff, cooking.

103
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,379
Okay.

104
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,680
Yeah, stock, seafood, and lighter seasoning.

105
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,399
Right, right.

106
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,240
And never overcook.

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,079
So we also cook our shrimp,

108
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,879
and the shrimp, the temperature has to be perfect

109
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,720
and not overcooked.

110
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,720
So I feel in the core of fandangy

111
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,079
and the core of the traditional Chinese cooking,

112
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,959
I'm much aligned.

113
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,879
I agree with you.

114
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,759
But you didn't go to find wisdom or inspiration

115
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,480
from the Chinese style of cooking, no?

116
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,439
Sometimes.

117
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,879
How curious are you in the Chinese cooking,

118
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,639
all the Chinese cooking styles?

119
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,680
I mean, I would love to actually spend time

120
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,399
in a Chinese kitchen.

121
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,000
But it's just kind of hard right now.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Then priority wise, learning ingredients and learning cooking styles?

123
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,920
I mean they're the same. Because usually when I find an ingredient, I research how it's

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,079
cooked locally first. And then I maybe take some ideas or maybe do something completely

125
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:53,079
different. But I'll always try to do it how the local might prepare the ingredient first.

126
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,879
Is it hard to learn or is it very different, the cooking techniques?

127
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,079
I mean to learn, to make it good is easy, to make it great is difficult. So I think

128
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,199
to be a master you need many years of experience and lots of understanding.

129
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,519
But I think if you just spend time in a kitchen, you already have a certain understanding of

130
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:23,560
how food, proteins, liquids, fats all react to different heat, temperatures, fermentation,

131
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,800
acids, all of these things kind of interact.

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,720
So if you know the foundations of cooking, you can kind of jump in any cooking style

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,680
and I think somewhat achieve good results.

134
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,839
But in Chinese cuisine, and I think the Chinese, you know, you make, you pick certain details

135
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,319
that are very, you know, like the Cantonese, the way they steam

136
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,360
a fish.

137
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,800
Even if I steamed it perfectly, it still wouldn't be good enough, you know, because they wouldn't

138
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
master it to perfection.

139
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Yeah, you know, you need to have some sort of street credit, you know, you need to be...

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,399
Street credit, but also the way it's presented.

141
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:11,199
Like the Cantonese require it to be right in front of you, you have ten seconds, and after the ten seconds it's going back. By the way, it's done here.

142
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,199
You cannot do that.

143
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,120
Yeah, exactly. So I can't approach it the same way. I have to do it differently. And

144
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,959
we tried to do some ingredients closer to traditional methods, and that was always the

145
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,000
biggest rejection in the

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,240
dining room. That's true. And so it's like okay you know let's all cook the way I

147
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,120
know how to cook best maybe with a little bit of influence or I can improve

148
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:53,320
my skills by understanding another type of skill you I think some hints of the traditional way of cooking can be pleasant in the experience,

149
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,320
but too much of it, then you draw yourself into this comparison that you don't want to.

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Yeah, exactly.

151
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,960
And then you become fusion, bad fusion.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,919
One big difference I noticed between Chinese cooking and Western cooking is in the sauce.

153
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:17,559
Most Chinese sauce is fermented, and most Western sauce is never fermented.

154
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,919
But we've been doing, or I've been doing fermented sauce very early, even in any country I worked

155
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:31,320
in. I think it's a big inspiration from Asian countries.

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,840
Western sauces now, I think, have a lot of fermentation involved in them.

157
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:49,639
Classically, Western sauces don't season, instead of salt, we use, you know, garum or soy sauces,

158
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,639
Jiangyus, however you want to call it, made from the ingredient.

159
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,639
So, instead of, you know, fermenting soybeans and rice, we ferment beef and rice.

160
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,639
You know, and that's, and then we season our beef shu with that.

161
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,919
And then instead of adding acid, vinegar,

162
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:14,919
which is also a type of fermentation, we might use another type of lacto-fermentation. So

163
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:21,879
we're just taking the same kind of core way of approaching a Western sauce, but we're

164
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,159
adding more flavor and more levels of flavor by using fermentation

165
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,200
subtly.

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,720
How do you like the, last question then.

167
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Okay.

168
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Yeah.

169
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,120
So how do you like the work experience here?

170
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,919
Like I know since you've been here, it's mostly COVID, right?

171
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,919
The pandemic.

172
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,919
Yeah, I guess.

173
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,919
I didn't even realize.

174
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, I mean, it's good. I miss home a little bit.

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But in terms of the work environments, it's well balanced.

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We don't do lunch here, which is, you know, I can come in to work.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I only work 12 hours, which is pretty good for a restaurant.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You mentioned 16 hours.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, when I first started some of the jobs, I worked 16 hours.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It depends. Like when I worked on the farm, your work and your life is very much mixed, right?

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because you wake up early to feed the animals.

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But you know, you might spend a couple hours outside in the garden,

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and then go into the kitchen to prepare the ingredients

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,100
and you eat with the whole family.

185
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,299
So your whole life is kind of about this whole cycle.

186
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:36,500
Here it's, you know, I don't have that privilege, but it's, you know,

187
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,799
I try to keep a positive work environment, you know, a lot of chefs are,

188
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:47,480
I get angry sometimes, but most of the time, you know, it's about, you know, we play music in the

189
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:56,600
kitchen, we try to have fun and laugh and cook good food for each other.

190
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,519
The customers, you start to figure out the customers?

191
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, and then I started to figure out the clients.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And you know, also our return guests, like Edward's saying,

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
we have quite a lot of information on them,

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
so we can give them dishes that we know what they'll like.

195
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Obviously, I'd like to do more than we are,

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
but it's always balancing what we can handle with the team.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,879
And then, yeah, the training the staff is also exciting too, and teaching them different

198
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,879
ways.

199
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,559
And now, after three years, we've had quite a few people come through the kitchen and

200
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,600
move on and continue their success.

201
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,279
So that's the most rewarding to be honest actually.

202
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,620
Is seeing the stories of these young generation of Chinese cooks.

203
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
Planting seeds.

204
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Yeah, exactly.

205
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,100
That's a good metaphor.

206
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,659
Planting seeds for the future growth.

207
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:03,179
And I'm curious to see because I think China has such a strong history, you know, more

208
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,200
than almost any other country.

209
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,080
And through that history, there's a lot of rules and traditions about cuisine and regions. And a lot of people, like you said, you know, this is how we do it in our region,

210
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,240
and this is what we care about. And it's good to have that. And it's good to have that history.

211
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,799
But it sometimes scares people from breaking away from those traditions, from being innovative.

212
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:36,399
And I see chefs in China, if they choose to work at a restaurant like An Su,

213
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,700
they're already making that choice to break away tradition and to see what else.

214
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,840
And I've got two chefs that have worked two years for me and now are running

215
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:54,159
their own kitchens. And I'm curious to see if I taught them. Because it's like how they

216
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:01,799
approach innovation and creating a new dish is very foreign for them. And that creativity,

217
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,000
and once you spark that, it's exciting to see.

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And since they have more knowledge about this tradition, I always feel like you need to respect it.

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There are going to be better chefs than me because of that.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Different chefs.

221
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Be aware of the tradition, know the context, but don't limit to have the freedom to break them or innovate.

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
Right.

223
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,120
Me too.

224
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,960
Last night after the dinner, I thanked Edward for bringing into two changes, this whole experience and the possibilities.

225
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,840
It's very exciting.

226
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,919
Thank you.

227
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,559
Thank you.

228
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,000
Thank you for the interview.

229
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,960
Thanks, guys.

230
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Thank you.

231
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,399
Mysterious AD.

232
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,600
All right.

233
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,080
Bye.

234
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,799
Bye.
