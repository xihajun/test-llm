00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hi folks, welcome back to my channel.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,219
Today is a special episode.

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:09,720
I have the honor of interviewing Vijay at his newly found startup, StatSig.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,140
Vijay and I both worked at Facebook, but I was here and he was there.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,320
Before leaving Facebook, Vijay was the VP and head of entertainment.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:27,280
So he was in charge of Facebook gaming, Facebook video, and other sorts of entertainments. Vijay is special because he has this high position

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,559
and successful career in a big tech company.

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,200
And then he left to start his own startup.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,240
But more than that, I'm a special fan of Vijay's work

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,920
because Vijay actually started a lot of successful product

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,520
at Facebook, which is actually rare in big companies.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,000
Like in big companies, people usually do one work well and they do it and they go to a

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,520
high position, but Vijay actually did five and they're all successful.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,219
Such kind of track record is also rare in big companies.

15
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,619
So he did Audience Network.

16
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:05,000
He did Neko, which is the mobile app as he also started a marketplace.

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,439
So I had a job at Facebook, thanks to Vijay,

18
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,000
I work on a marketplace.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,959
He also started Facebook gaming and Facebook video.

20
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,519
All these five products are super successful

21
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,000
and Vijay started them from scratch.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,040
If you, especially like if you consider

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,640
how many successful products Facebook launched

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
over the past few years,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
this is actually very phenomenal.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Within Facebook, Vijay is viewed as this godfather figure to the engineers.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He gives very transparent advice for engineers, and he can inspire people by his vision.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,879
Also, the five teams VijJ started share a very common trait

29
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,760
scrappy. The meaning and importance of being scrappy in product development is

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,200
worth its own episode so I won't go there today but I do think that is a big

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,000
part of why VJ's team are so successful and also I have high hopes for his

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
startup.

33
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,439
Into this episode, I want to show you

34
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,520
how working at a very early startup look like.

35
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,000
Vijay is very transparent.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,060
I actually filmed their standup meeting.

37
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,919
So in a standup meeting, they talk actual business,

38
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,719
talk actual problem.

39
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,000
So this is the most insider view you can get into a startup.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,280
I also interviewed Vijay to ask about his life stories,

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,039
what made him decide to do startup, and also his recommendations for common folks like you and I,

42
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:41,919
especially junior folks who work at a tech company, how to optimize our career for the

43
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,360
things we want to grow. All right, so without further ado,

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,759
let's start the interview.

45
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,719
Hi, Vijay.

46
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,240
Hey, good to have you.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,800
Thank you, and yeah, thank you for inviting me here.

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,039
Yeah. It's a very cool place.

49
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,800
It's always good to have visitors.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Yeah, so let's get to it.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,360
Like, you left Facebook from a very high position

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,240
with a lot of successful track records.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,800
And so, like, the future of Facebook is bright.

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,719
But then you started this company

55
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,159
with probably a lot of uncertainties.

56
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,000
There is.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,520
Yeah, so I guess, what is your story?

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,400
So my story is this.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,159
I started at Microsoft and spent 10 years at Microsoft

60
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,300
building various different products. I was an engineer there. And and spent 10 years at Microsoft building various different products.

61
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,780
I was an engineer there.

62
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,639
And then after 10 years, I decided I wanna do something

63
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,300
different for the next decade.

64
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,759
And so I went and joined Facebook as an engineer in 2011.

65
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,979
When I joined Facebook, it was a very small company.

66
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,199
We had, it is still called a startup.

67
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,120
We had only like 600 engineers.

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,580
And then I built various products

69
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,360
and then went up in career ladder

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,919
and I spent 10 years at Facebook.

71
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,520
So that was my second decade.

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,240
And when I left, I was the head of engineering,

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm sorry, head of entertainment,

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,800
taking care of engineering and product teams

75
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,960
that included video gaming, music, sports, and so on.

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,620
So that was my second decade.

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,159
So when it came close to the decade, I kind of like thought, what should my third decade

78
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,159
look like?

79
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,959
And so lots of opportunities in the world, but there's one that is always special, which

80
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,160
is if you start your own company and how would that look

81
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,399
like and what a startup journey would look like was always a curiosity

82
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,199
something that I really wanted to do and so the timing was right for my third

83
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
decade to come and start a company so that's what happened with Statsync.

84
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,160
I already have so many questions because I sense a philosophy in how you count in decades.

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,279
And two, when you joined Facebook, it was a startup.

86
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,519
Funny that I never thought about it that way, right?

87
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,079
Like I think, like you left a big company,

88
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,240
joining another big company,

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,399
but actually you left a big company and joined a startup.

90
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,759
So let's start with the first one.

91
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
What is the philosophy?

92
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,680
You said the timing is right

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,560
because this is right around the decade.

94
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Why?

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,439
Yeah, I think a lot of it is basically personal.

96
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,920
For me, I came to the US in 2001 and I was for Microsoft.

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,240
And I happened to leave Microsoft in 2011 and joined Facebook in 2011.

98
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
And so naturally for me,

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,600
2021 was a natural kind of moment

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,079
to reflect on like what should my next decade be?

101
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,720
So that's how it ended up for me.

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,759
It may not be the same for everyone.

103
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,959
And a decade is not necessarily the time period you want to think about, but it

104
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,959
just so happened for me that way.

105
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,800
And the interesting thing is like, you know, the opportunities are also there.

106
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,060
When you start looking for them, it'll appear.

107
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:06,279
But does it mean like, I guess my question is, during a decade at Facebook,

108
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,680
was there a time you were thinking about your career,

109
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,240
reflecting, or did you just wait until, you know?

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,279
Yeah, I always think about my career.

111
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,560
One thing I always do is to like,

112
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,199
what do I want to do in the next five years?

113
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,319
And then once I understand what I want to do in five years,

114
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,120
then I make sure that whatever I'm doing today

115
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,079
leads me to that five years.

116
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,480
So I'll give you an example.

117
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
Five years into Facebook,

118
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,639
I was pretty certain that I want to go do my own company,

119
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,100
build my own company.

120
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,759
So then the question was,

121
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,759
okay, what experiences or expertise do I have to gather

122
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,180
in order to go do my own company?

123
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,800
And am I gathering that now?

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
So that made me make some decisions.

125
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,379
So one of the important decisions I made was

126
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,480
I was the head of engineering for Marketplace,

127
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,680
Facebook Marketplace.

128
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,519
I decided to leave the head of engineering

129
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,560
for Facebook Marketplace and then go start a new

130
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,220
product unit called gaming

131
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,319
and became the product group lead for gaming.

132
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,040
So what that made me is like getting the experience

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,199
on managing product managers, designers,

134
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,839
working with designers, working with researchers,

135
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,240
working with content strategy and data scientists

136
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,279
and a lot of other exposure that I wouldn't have gotten

137
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,240
if I was just an engineering leader.

138
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,279
So that was important because I know that if you're going to do a startup, you have

139
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,560
to hire a designer, hire a researcher, hire a marketing lead.

140
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,879
And so you need to be able to know what the role entails.

141
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,839
And so to me, leading up to building a startup was all about gaining those experiences.

142
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,040
Funny that Mary actually told me this.

143
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,319
You gave this advice to engineers.

144
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,959
You'd ask them, what do you optimize for?

145
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,839
And if you want to build a startup,

146
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,600
you shouldn't go for middle management.

147
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,560
You want to start a new product.

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,399
Yeah, exactly.

149
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,759
But was that possible?

150
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,800
How did it make the change?

151
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
Did Facebook allow it or did they make a swing case?

152
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:12,160
I think, so for me, was going from like head of engineering to when I had about 100 people

153
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,800
reporting in my org to taking on 12 engineers.

154
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,560
So it was a lot of people think of that as a step down.

155
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,199
But for me it felt like it's more different experiences. So it actually

156
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,639
like stretched me in other ways than the size of the org. So for me, the size of the org

157
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:41,940
didn't matter. And so those kinds of changes are always possible, but very rare that people

158
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,899
actually take it. So but I recommend that Yeah, I had a video about your growth method

159
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:52,980
But like you are not only the growing in terms of career actually growing your skills

160
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,220
Yes, and but you must have very strong conviction of that you want to start our own company

161
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,519
but like was it because you see an opportunity and you want to do something or

162
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,759
Do you just want to try startup

163
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,679
and being the founder of something?

164
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,379
What's the mission or motivation behind doing it all?

165
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,039
When you wanna go do a startup

166
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,779
or actually even join an early, early startup,

167
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,759
there's a huge element of craziness.

168
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,720
There's a huge element of craziness. So there's a huge element of uncertainty and combined with like, you know,

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,720
some irrational fate in where the startup is going,

170
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,779
what the people are gonna do and so on.

171
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:43,220
So every single startup has those elements.

172
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,080
And if everybody was making rational decisions

173
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,000
about what is the expected outcome

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
and then multiply that with the value,

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,039
nobody will ever go start a startup.

176
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,200
But nobody will ever go join an early, early stage startup

177
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,919
because the odds will always work against you.

178
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,240
So to me, it's more of like, do you have the conviction

179
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,879
that this will be a good idea to invest in? Do you have the right people to take that idea,

180
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:26,600
execute on the idea and take it further? Do you have the time? And then there's also like, you know, there are times in your life where it's more easy.

181
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,379
I think it's easier to go do a startup.

182
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,000
There's elements of financial security comes into play

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,559
where, you know, for me, I have like two kids.

184
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,639
What stages my kids are in, that comes into play.

185
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,320
Am I, is my wife supportive of this?

186
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,600
Those are, there's a lot of factors that go into,

187
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,120
going into like, you know, leaving behind a very nice,

188
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,000
comfortable, and a more dependable job

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,559
to come and like, you know, start a startup,

190
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,360
which is, yes, lots of risks.

191
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,919
That's actually, I think, partially answers the question

192
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,539
I wanted to ask, because as an economist, I think partially answers the question I wanted to ask because as an economist I think about opportunity cost

193
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:11,220
and as a Facebook VP the opportunity cost is high, but

194
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,580
Maybe you like because you optimize for different things

195
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:22,480
You don't view that as opportunity cost you view that as a foundation or yeah

196
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,360
Yeah, I think there's a you I think there's two sides, right?

197
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,240
So the opportunity cost of going and starting a startup, which could become big, and then

198
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:49,000
continuing on in the side of like a VP at Facebook, you get good pay, you have a stable job, but the upsides are capped.

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,600
There's the stuff that you keep doing in the large company, in a large org, which is very,

200
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,000
very different from what I'm doing now in a startup as a CEO.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:09,480
So the opportunity cost of not experiencing a startup CEO role is the downside of being

202
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,960
an exec.

203
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,120
So did it turn out to be what you expected?

204
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I don't know.

205
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
It's too early.

206
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,080
It's only three and a half months, but I'm having a blast.

207
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,600
We're having a lot of fun.

208
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,200
This is one of the best teams that I could have gathered. And so these are folks that are very, very good.

209
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,720
And I think I have set all the environment factors to go

210
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,440
and increase the odds of us becoming successful.

211
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,759
But we have to wait and see where it actually goes,

212
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,320
how far we can take this startup, how patient we are.

213
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,039
And there's a lot of

214
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,720
factors here, so it's hard to say anything at this point.

215
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,679
Yeah, but regardless of the success, it's going to be a risky decision,

216
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,960
but there must be one thing, right? For you, is it the

217
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:08,000
experience or I want to make this product work? I want to create this company and this product?

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,799
I think it's an element of both.

219
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,200
So number one, I really want to make the startup successful.

220
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,000
I want to make the company successful by making the product

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,799
and the people that use the product successful.

222
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,600
So to me, it's very, very important that we provide the right product

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,039
and make the people, the customers that use our product very, very important that we provide the right product and make the people, the customers

224
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,940
that use our product very, very successful.

225
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,519
So there's a huge, huge drive from there.

226
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,519
There's also an element of like this startup, this journey that I'm on, I will never forget

227
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,519
in my life.

228
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:47,000
This is like I'm creating a milestone and memories of like, you know, building startup.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's an experience that can never be acquired unless you actually go through it.

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And so, to me, you know, hey, if I run really, really hard, really fast for the next two, three years,

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and even if the startup fails, I would always remember this moment till the end of my life.

232
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So in a way, we're creating these memories.

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
All right. Actually, that's kind of my last question.

234
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah.

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, would it fail? And how would success failure look to you?

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,519
How does success failure look like to you?

237
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,559
And if it fails, are you prepared to fail?

238
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,559
Yeah, absolutely.

239
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,080
I mean, if you're going to go to startup, be prepared to fail.

240
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,639
But the other thing is, I would say, that's the plan B, but never optimize for plan B.

241
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,720
Plan A is always about success.

242
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
So believe in making your startup into a success.

243
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,480
That's what I believe.

244
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,200
I believe, if anyone asks me,

245
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,039
are you gonna be successful?

246
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,960
Absolutely, we're gonna be successful.

247
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,080
But are you prepared to fail?

248
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,100
Yes, if you're not prepared to fail, don't jump.

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,539
I think that's the takeaway from here.

250
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,759
But look, this is the thing about startups.

251
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,000
There's an element of irrational behavior

252
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,799
where you leap without a parachute,

253
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,240
but you expect to land safely,

254
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,200
and that's all what startups do.

255
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,399
And you make it happen along the way.

256
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,340
With the right team, with the right execution,

257
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,120
with the right people, and a lot of luck,

258
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,379
you will land safely.

259
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,580
And that's all we're all hoping for.

260
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,179
They started logging today,

261
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,240
but if you go to the metrics page,

262
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,539
you just see basically nothing.

263
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,259
So I'm making it so you see the hourly view.

264
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,419
And there's like, so right now we show

265
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,139
the events count per day.

266
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,580
I'm gonna have it be, if you don't have

267
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,059
the events count for the day,

268
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,539
we'd show events counts per hour.

269
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:47,000
Otherwise we show events count in the last hour, having created gates.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
When you go to the console, it defaults you to the metrics page.

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You're only pulling the remnants...

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, because we only pull the last, like, 100 events actively.

273
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, you have to stream all the events to all regions.

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, which one of these.
