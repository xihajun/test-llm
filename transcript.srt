1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
So today, I'd like to introduce our speaker, who is also a

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,599
Cornell student. But right now, he after he graduates from

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:17,160
Cornell, he actually has a lot of decisions on how to make a

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,239
change from one job to another. He was he had experience in

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,839
building setups. And he also has some inter experience in BCG. So, and later after he chose to not to

6
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,640
do consulting anymore and to switch to Amazon and right now

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,399
he's a senior data scientist on Facebook. So I feel is, you

8
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,399
know, he has this is his name is being tied with so many big

9
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,679
names of this, you of these great companies.

10
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:55,079
And especially during our personal interaction, I also know Yu Zheng had also wanted to stay

11
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:07,680
in academia, but later he made a transition and go to a non-academia world so i'm really excited to be able to uh have him as our uh second

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:17,040
the speaker of our second episode and i i think you will also learn a lot uh especially at this

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,920
stage of your phd you probably you are having some uh you know you probably want to stay in

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
academia and you also want to uh explore the world. And you also want to explore the world outside. And I

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,400
think you will benefit a lot from today's talk. So be her

16
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,719
introduced the rules.

17
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,079
Yeah, just a couple of housekeeping rules before we

18
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,200
start. So we would appreciate it if you meet yourself during the

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,000
talk to eliminate background noise, but you know, feel free to open your camera if you want. And then at

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,799
the end of the talk, we'll leave a lot of time for q&a, which I

21
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,439
think is going to be very, the most the more interesting part

22
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,079
where you can actually directly ask each and any questions. If

23
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,000
you want to ask directly, then just type raise hand in the chat box and then we will give the mic to you.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you're a bit shy, you can type in the questions in the chat box and then one of us will read it out loud.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,199
Please don't ask too many questions, maybe not more than two, but definitely encourage everyone to at least ask one question. I think, oh,

26
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,599
last thing, when you're asking questions, it'd be great to turn

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,599
on your video because it just always feels more personal to

28
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,759
see the person face to face. So that's pretty much everything.

29
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,000
Should we give the floor to our speaker?

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,560
Definitely. So I just stopped sharing. Yijun, can you start

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:44,919
sharing?

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,280
So I just stopped sharing. You john, can you start sharing?

33
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,039
Hey.

34
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:52,800
Yeah, so thank you for inviting us. Thank you for having this

35
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:56,919
series. I'm going to talk about that in my presentation as well

36
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:09,240
because that is one of the biggest lessons learned I learned as well. Like, looking back to my PhD years that I didn't spend much time knowing what's out there. So

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,599
just stayed on my epidemiopaths for too long. And that is one of

38
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,879
my biggest regrets of my of my life. Otherwise, I'll be much

39
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,599
richer than what I am right now. Okay, so thank you. And one more thing.

40
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,919
Sometimes I do not control the pace of my pace of my speak

41
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:36,439
well. And if you find something unclear, feel free to interrupt

42
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,120
me and ask me to repeat what do I actually mean. All right,

43
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Alright, I'll start sharing. Okay, so from econ PhD to tech,

44
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:57,520
I guess the first part is going to be a brief introduction of my

45
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,879
journey. And the second is my lessons and kind of my three devices. So self intro,

46
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,520
this is just a screenshot of my thinking. Right now I'm a senior

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,360
data scientist on Facebook, I do Facebook e commerce, not the

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,759
Facebook shops, the marketplace citizenship. So if you I guess

49
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,560
most of us are from China is kind of saying you in the

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,319
American version. And before that, I was an economist at Amazon. So we do

51
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,399
so that Okay, so the difference between these two jobs at Amazon

52
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,399
as an economist, I got to do a lot of what I do in PhD. So I

53
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,240
read academic papers, I do models, I read machine learning

54
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,160
causal inference models. But as a data scientist at Facebook, I mostly

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,720
just do SQL to get data, and then taproot to plot two charts,

56
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
basically, I just pop our charts. And then I do kind of

57
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,040
analytics. So I tell people what does the data mean, and how

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,920
does that drives our decisions. So I'm basically using, I guess

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,360
second year statistical information I'm not doing

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,040
anything that is related to my PhD education. And I'm actually

61
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,319
pretty happy about my current job. And I'll talk later about

62
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,879
past dependent, and you wish we don't

63
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,079
need to just use what we learned we should unconstrained

64
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,720
optimization, but let's save that talk later. And before

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,920
that, it was Cornell PhD in economics, and it's six years.

66
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,480
And I hope this stays as four years that I would have much

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,939
better much more experience

68
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,839
and join the tech companies much earlier.

69
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,379
But okay, on the right is my dissertation.

70
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,199
So the dissertation is about firms,

71
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,060
investors and stock markets.

72
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,879
My job market paper is the real impact of IPO.

73
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,360
So using some natural

74
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,399
shock happening in China to understand the real impact of

75
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:18,959
IPO on like the impact of IPO on real economy. But now, when I

76
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,720
look back into my dissertation, I don't even care about what

77
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,439
conclusion I drew because it has no impact on the real world. Okay. And before

78
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:37,120
I graduate, so I graduated in August 2017. And before I

79
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,480
graduate, I spent three months as a summer consultant at BCG

80
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:49,839
in business office. I liked the experience a lot, but for some personal reasons, I chose to come back to the

81
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:56,959
States and do being tech. And during my PhD, so these are

82
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:04,360
during my PhD, I had some very strange, I guess, abnormal or

83
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,740
strange, I guess, abnormal or not normal experiences as a PhD student.

84
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,160
We founded a ramen shop in New York City.

85
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
And we did some, I guess, college grocery delivery

86
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
business at Cornell.

87
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,560
So it's almost like Amazon Fresh.

88
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,160
We ran weekly delivery from New York City to

89
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,040
Cornell campuses and deliver to student dorms. So definitely

90
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,639
raise that eyebrow. These are some screenshots. This is the

91
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,319
ramen shop. And we did a holiday market by a Korean town. That

92
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:48,079
was like we go there every morning and the market starts at 11 I think then we do we just

93
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:58,480
make Japanese ramen and we close at I forgot maybe 9 p.m and then we wash the pots the dishes and do

94
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:08,199
it all over again the next day not not me so but I helped. And this is the picture for the college grocery.

95
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,639
So we made posters, we collaborate with New York City

96
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
Chinese grocery store and we deliver other stuff

97
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
to campuses.

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,439
So this is you, you get an order on our website,

99
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,759
we get our stuff in New York City and we deliver it to you.

100
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,000
And this is kind of our delivery. We get our stuff in New York City and we deliver to you.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,560
And this is kind of our delivery.

102
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,200
So this car goes from New York City to Ithaca and in boxes.

103
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,879
So the hierarchical shares at New York City puts the stuff into boxes and then we sort

104
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,279
into individual orders.

105
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,799
We had to do this because we didn't have a big enough car from New York City to Ithaca.

106
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,759
All right, so all those experiences, right?

107
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,799
What is my biggest lesson?

108
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,720
The biggest lesson is I enjoy my life much better

109
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,399
than after PhD than I was during PhD.

110
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,720
So during PhD PhD I also lived

111
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,399
up. I don't know like I like to explore, I like to do different

112
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,559
things. But when I had this constant fear of failing that

113
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,960
what if I don't get my PhD, what if I fail at academia, my peers

114
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,759
are studying and doing research, and they're so much smarter than

115
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,639
me. What I'm doing, you know, enjoying my life. So

116
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,240
I like if I go out and just have some fun, I would have a lot of

117
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,519
self guilt. And that is not a very pleasant feeling. If you

118
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:47,279
want you are you anxiety and fear, I guess. So after PhD, because I sell my

119
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,600
time to the company, I get to separate work versus life, no

120
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
matter how much or hours I put in my work, I get to enjoy my

121
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,519
own life. So an anecdote story is in PCG Beijing, the hours

122
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:09,559
were quite crazy. So I had to work 9 a.m. to about average 2 a.m.

123
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,759
Sometimes I go home at 12 and I feel like

124
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,759
today is a very lucky day because I get to go home 12 a.m.

125
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:22,000
And sometimes you have to go home at 5 a.m.

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,519
and wake up the next day,

127
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,360
wake up the same day, wake up the same day,

128
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,159
sleeping like three hours, but I still felt better than my PhD.

129
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,000
That was during my PhD time, like that was before my graduation, I still feel better doing the consulting work with

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,159
such a long hour than what I experienced during PhD because I

131
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:50,679
get to separate work and life. So and I get to quite like be myself basically, after

132
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,600
work, and that felt very good. And the last thing to mention is

133
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,200
living expenses, you get to earn much more after PhD. So that's a

134
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,000
big bonus. And this is kind of my Instagram story archive.

135
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,519
I just,

136
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,580
so not happening since I graduated from PhD.

137
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,559
Yeah.

138
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,779
I got to do things.

139
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, that's lesson number one. And if I could do my PhD all over again, what would I do? So first, I didn't have this theory.

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I didn't have this world beyond academia, certainly, when I was

141
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in PhD, if I had that maybe I can realize much sooner that

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
academia is not what I want to do. So the first thing I want to

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,879
do is admit that I don't want to do is admit that I don't want to

144
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,080
do academia in my second year instead of my sixth year. I

145
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,919
stayed in PhD for six years, because I always think that, you

146
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,720
know, the best people in my best peers that are doing academia.

147
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,279
And that is

148
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,320
how the how PhD is supposed to do how we are supposed to do

149
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,720
academia. So I came here to do academia, I should do academia.

150
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,279
If I feel like I don't want to do academia, that is just

151
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,279
because things things are getting too hard. So I'm quitting. I equate

152
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,240
not interested in academia as funding excuse for quitting. So

153
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,960
I just stayed for too long. If I realize I don't like if I

154
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,919
realized that I honestly do not want to do PhD, I would have

155
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,799
told my committee that I don't want to do academia as soon as I

156
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,799
found that. And then I'll start

157
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,120
looking for industry internships. So I didn't do any

158
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,639
industry internships during my PhD. So the BCG is my first kind

159
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,879
of internship experience during my PhD, I would have done in

160
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,879
industry internships. And that would prepare me for much better

161
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,480
industry internships, and that would prepare me for much better

162
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,159
position or situation when I was looking for industry jobs, that I would have finished my PhD in four years instead of six,

163
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,120
because I don't think there was any extra value for me off of

164
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,399
the society by me staying in my PhD program for six years. And one thing I'm not

165
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,879
sure if it's achievable, but maybe if I realize I don't want

166
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,600
to do academia, that is during my PhD, I should have separated

167
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,440
my work from my life. I should have just had work hours and

168
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,320
nothing about the research and the other stuff I do after the

169
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,639
work hours. Because when I think back, I have self guilt.

170
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,019
I feel guilty not working.

171
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,240
So I constantly think about my work,

172
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,879
but it didn't help my productivity.

173
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,200
I feel like looking back, if I separated my work

174
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,879
and the life, I could be more productive in work

175
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,759
and much happier in life. So that is another lesson.

176
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,840
Alright, so three advices after having this lesson and spending

177
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,480
a couple years after academia. Advice number two is know

178
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
yourself, because I didn't. and I wasn't completely honest

179
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,519
with myself. And I think it's a very easy bias, like, like not

180
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,320
knowing yourself is common knowing yourself is difficult.

181
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,399
So know what is your true interest and your strengths,

182
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,000
like we are all good at studying well good at reading papers,

183
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,000
good at doing research. That's why we are here.

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But beyond that, what is our strengths? And most importantly, what actually drives you? Like, do you feel excited doing research?

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:07,559
So I was, okay, so this part, the reason, part of the reason I stayed in academia for a long is I was actually very interested in research. I was in empirical

186
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,940
cover finance, and actually found the papers are

187
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,259
interesting. And I enjoy reading papers and I enjoy doing

188
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:23,700
research. But even even with that, I still feel like I do not

189
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,519
want to do academia because what

190
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,840
actually drives me is having an impact on the world. I don't

191
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,039
feel like I was doing that. By doing research, like the paper

192
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,559
I write, I don't think it's it can actually create the impact I

193
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:51,000
wanted to I want to I want for myself. Yeah, so understanding your underlying motivation is

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,639
very important. And then have a come, like, be honest about what

195
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,600
are your resources, what you can do. And sometimes knowing this

196
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,679
takes trying, like you don't know what you don't know, right.

197
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,980
So you had to try. Like, in fact, they have to

198
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,240
build this a minimal, minimal valuable products to validate

199
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,419
your assumptions. Sometimes it doesn't take much, for example,

200
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:21,340
coming to this series and listen to was beyond academia is a way

201
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,039
of knowing. Doing internships is a great way to try,

202
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,759
if you like, to really get to know the day-to-day

203
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
of different jobs,

204
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,440
and really understand if that is what you want to do, right?

205
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,720
And also, when you try,

206
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
now there are a lot of two-way door decisions,

207
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,639
especially when you are in PhD.

208
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,120
So for example, if you do an internship in industry, if you don't like

209
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,299
it, you can still come back, you can still do academia. So a lot

210
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,759
of decisions are two way door, that means you can just try and

211
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,799
come back, there is no, not much harm for trying. So definitely

212
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,519
take those opportunities. And try like the industry, the industry internship or the industry

213
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,599
experiences, if even if you decide to do academia, will be

214
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,759
good for your research and for academic job because you know,

215
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,720
like, for example, what kind of data is out there, what people

216
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,920
actually care about, and maybe you build some connections,

217
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,119
maybe like the like having multiple dimensional of experiences is going to help

218
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,319
you not going to hurt you. Otherwise, number two is

219
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,599
unconstrained optimization is always better than constraint

220
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,200
on maybe a bigger equal to bigger than equal to, but it's

221
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,480
like most of the case is better, right? Sometimes it's equal.

222
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,000
Sometimes we stuck in academia for too long. And that is, I guess, echoes because earlier point

223
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,640
that a lot of people stay in academia because one they don't

224
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,920
know what they can do outside of academia. And to. They want to

225
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,759
use the dispense so much time in academia, they spend so much

226
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:07,920
time in research, they want to use that they want to play that

227
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,200
strength. And they don't want to just give it up. But that is, I

228
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,400
guess, a bias itself. Like, just think about what makes you happy

229
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,759
tomorrow, or in 10 years or in 20 years of our life. It's not

230
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:25,960
going to be like, a lot of cases, it's not going to be like, a lot of cases is

231
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,079
not going to be just, you know, repeating what you did for the

232
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,039
past 10 years. If today there are two choices, option number

233
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,839
one leads to a better life in 10 years or even in one year,

234
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,799
option number two is doing what you have been doing or what you

235
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,960
are good at. but you are going

236
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,680
to be less happy in one year.

237
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,799
Choose option number one.

238
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,480
Don't choose option number two just

239
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,039
because you did option number two for such a long time.

240
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,119
So do unconstrained optimization.

241
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,359
Don't let your past constrain you.

242
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:07,200
So past dependent, sunk cost, loss a version, those are things that stop you from

243
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,079
trying new things. And I talked about this earlier, like, really be honest about yourself,

244
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:25,440
not only like admitting your strengths and your shortcomings, but also, you know, sometimes it's okay to quit and know that it's okay to

245
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,880
quit. I was I guess, for me, it was my ego and pride, or like

246
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,900
myself, discipline, that got into my way of admitting I'm not

247
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,420
interested in academia. So it goes both ways, right? So really

248
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,319
be completely honest with yourself.

249
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,920
And the cost, the second part is,

250
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,279
the cost, a lot of times, the cost of not acting

251
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,799
is bigger than the risk of acting.

252
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,960
And PhD, the program definitely gives you a shelter,

253
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,599
an excuse to not act.

254
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,859
What do I mean by this?

255
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,000
If you are a PhD

256
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:18,079
in Western schools, right, it's five years program, it is, it is a very long time. And, and the program doesn't ask you much

257
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,599
results until the end, because they want to give you some

258
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,000
freedom to, to really

259
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,680
focus and do research without the worry that, you know, next

260
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,519
week, I will tell you how to do next month, what I have to do,

261
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,559
to give you some stipends, and they give you a very limited

262
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,960
environment. And to tell you, you know, just focus on

263
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,200
research. So it's a shelter to not try in different things

264
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,039
because for example, for me,

265
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,880
before every summer I stayed at Cornell

266
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,839
and did extra research.

267
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,839
You're apply for a summer RA or TA,

268
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,200
and then I stay at school and I go to library every day

269
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,640
to do research instead of applying for an internship.

270
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,220
And I felt pretty good about my decision

271
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,900
because I was focusing on research.

272
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,400
I didn't waste any of my time.

273
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,400
But now if you ask me, what did I do summer of,

274
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,960
I don't know, 2015, I don't remember.

275
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,119
I don't remember what paper I read. I don't remember what research I did. I feel like

276
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,079
it's a complete, it's not complete waste of time, but it

277
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:38,440
is a waste of time. So that was the cost of me not having not

278
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,960
acting to apply for summer internship. And I guess that's

279
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,839
an easy trap for a lot of

280
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,599
PhD because the program is set up this way. So think about what

281
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,400
is the cost of you not acting? And what is the risk if you

282
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,519
actually act? A lot of the time the risk of acting is very

283
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:08,599
small, you actually benefit from acting and the cost of not acting is ignored. But the best number

284
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,720
three is no ready know what's out there. And this one I think

285
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,759
is, I guess, in terms of risk reward is definitely everyone

286
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,000
should just know, like, you know, you should know your

287
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,680
options beyond academia, right? So coming to this talk, again,

288
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,759
you should know your options beyond academia, right? So coming to this talk again, it's great.

289
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,200
Your options, what industries you can go.

290
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,779
Like I hear a lot of you either come from consulting

291
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:36,579
or come from, or want to do consulting.

292
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:38,359
Consulting is a great industry.

293
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,799
I, later on, I'll like post a screenshot

294
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,079
of my YouTube channel.

295
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:50,960
And I talked about the value of consulting that brings to the

296
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,400
to to the firm that hires consultants. I think it's a great industry. But beyond consulting, there are also a lot

297
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,720
of other industry that industries that just hire a PhD

298
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,279
because you are a PhD because

299
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,079
you are a PhD, for example, tech, hires all sorts of people

300
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,200
to solve their problems, whether it's data, whether it's

301
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,000
optimization, like some operation research. And

302
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,000
sometimes it's even like material science, mechanical

303
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,839
engineering, at this heart, all sorts of PhD. So no options, I guess, consulting and data, all the

304
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:37,200
PhDs can just get into and try. So no was really like, no,

305
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,200
average salary, no career paths. And what do they do day to day?

306
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,960
Yeah, really know what to do.. So then you can fairly assess, are you going to be interested in

307
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,440
this type of job or should I do something else. And also now

308
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,880
option if you choose to do something else. For example, if

309
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,880
you just take a computer science master, or if you go to go do

310
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,519
some internship, or if you prepare an interview for half a year,

311
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,119
or maybe you take some, I don't know,

312
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,279
machine learning courses,

313
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,599
and you build your resume that way.

314
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:21,059
It will open a lot of different options for you.

315
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:26,660
So now, based on your current capacity, and based on

316
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:32,420
what you can do in a year, no options and really do the

317
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:38,420
unconstrained optimization. And then the I guess, the last part

318
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,660
is chance of success. And that leads to my next slide, how to

319
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,519
increase our chance of success

320
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,660
of getting what you want to, what you try to get.

321
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,000
So find the gap between what you want to do.

322
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,640
The first is know what you want to do, right?

323
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,359
And know other industries,

324
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,500
know what career you want to choose.

325
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,480
For example, a lot of you want to do consulting,

326
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,400
that's great.

327
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,000
Then what is the gap between your current resume, between current knowledge, experiences, projects,

328
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
do you have the right internships to get to consulting?

329
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Are they going to take your resume and give you an interview?

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And then you need to prepare for interviews, right?

331
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,519
And sometimes building connections can give you either recommendations, referral, or just

332
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:35,400
give you some knowledge and, you know, tell you what's the most effective way to prepare

333
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,380
for interview or to bridge our gap.

334
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:51,160
So this is, I guess, an action item. Know what's out there. Have access, like a fair, honest access of yourself.

335
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,720
And then start acting to close the gap.

336
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,119
I have a YouTube video about data science, what

337
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,200
data scientists do.

338
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,279
And today, I'm going to meet with a friend

339
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:11,200
and shoot another video to talk about how to close the gap to get into data science.

340
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,200
So what companies are looking for and how do you prepare,

341
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,000
what materials do you need to do to prepare for, to close the gap.

342
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,599
So stay tuned and subscribe.

343
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,200
All right.

344
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,680
So this is a screenshot of my YouTube channel.

345
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,759
For example, talk about A-B testing,

346
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,680
talk about how AI is applied in big tech companies,

347
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,799
what is management consulting, and what is data science.

348
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,880
I have some Juhu articles, maybe in the future

349
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
about also making videos based on these articles.

350
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,640
But this one, for example, talks about how you prepare for mock interview. I guess, okay, a little bit about

351
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,240
myself. Maybe here. Yeah, it's all going to be okay. Yeah, a

352
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,599
little bit about myself in the end. So one, because you are a

353
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,359
PhD, you're all smart and diligent, otherwise you won't be able to get here.

354
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,920
People, a lot of people, like a lot of us

355
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,319
have imposer syndrome that, you know,

356
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,440
we got here because of lack or because,

357
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,440
but everyone, all my peers are smarter than me,

358
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,720
so I must be the imposer, I must be faking it.

359
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,400
No, you deserve the PhD,

360
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,599
you're smart and intelligent. And you actually have better resource than most people. I'm not

361
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:38,559
only talking about the advisors, your professors, the class you can take, you can take most classes

362
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:49,119
for free as a PhD. So take those classes, do the projects, build your resume. But also, even if you try to fake, if you want to,

363
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:58,359
for example, a lot of people in tech, AI is very easy to fake.

364
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,279
Not to fake, but very easy to get to know.

365
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,400
For example, machine learning is just basically

366
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,400
it takes takes a month or, or maybe three months to get to know

367
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,039
AI well, if you're ready to prepare for it. So if it takes

368
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,359
three months, and prepare, like learn about AI and then you take

369
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,359
another three months write a paper about AI. Maybe it's not, it's useful,

370
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,240
maybe it's not. But HR because our PhD will pay attention to

371
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,400
you. And it's what adds, it's what boosts our resume and give

372
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,680
you a chance to most tech companies. So that is the

373
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,440
resource that many people do not have. Then you can maximize

374
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,839
your experience on one dimension.

375
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,619
You maximize the experience on one dimension.

376
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,559
So I, when I was doing consulting, I was back in Beijing

377
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,559
and my, I guess my peers, people who are at my same age,

378
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,140
I had with people who do startups

379
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,039
and a lot of them were quite successful.

380
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:13,440
They started companies that have well-known names, and they had, like, if they went to

381
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
industry, some of them are directors.

382
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,640
They were quite successful.

383
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,480
But I feel like I didn't waste my time doing PhD because I met, I also, like, because I

384
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,400
had title of PhD, I maximize my experience out of academia.

385
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:34,799
And so pH doing doing PhD in academia is really like playing

386
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,799
at a very high level, right? And not many people get to see that.

387
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,039
So if you draw an analogy in sports, it's almost like playing

388
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,000
a youth team for football club, right? You got to the top level, you know, what

389
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:51,799
the top level looks like. Or like if you're funded, a

390
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,000
mildly successful successful startup, if you're like, you

391
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,039
don't know what, what does it take to be a to be a true,

392
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,480
truly successful startup. But you like you interact with the

393
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,799
best scholars in the world. And you have this title that stays with you for a whole life

394
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,119
that says, you know, you are a PhD, you complete a great deal

395
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,440
in academia, and you are one of the smartest people in the

396
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,680
world. So that's great. It's all going to be okay. I want to, oh,

397
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:31,359
one last thing about myself. Yeah. I wasted and not wasted. I spent six years in

398
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,599
optimia, and only to realize, on my sixth year, but I don't

399
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:48,799
really want to do optimia. So I applied the BCG, going back to my resume, I applied the BCG job, I think December 2016

400
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,519
and got the internship January 2017,

401
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,799
sorry, got the interview January 2017.

402
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,559
I prepared a week for my mock interviews and got

403
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,200
the internship and got in. So one is I had article about how

404
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
to prepare mock interviews, how to prepare the interviews

405
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,039
efficiently. But two, I feel like that's a lucky shot. And

406
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,279
then at Amazon, like I didn't apply to any tech

407
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,880
jobs. Amazon is the only one applied, I got the interview and

408
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,519
I got him. And later I discovered that is kind of one

409
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:43,160
of the best jobs that I can, I can ever have. So a lot of this

410
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,759
is luck. But I don't think it's purely luck. It's also because

411
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:56,000
I have the title, I had some experiences during PhD, and I spent the time and ready to prepare

412
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:07,000
for the interview. So there are a lot of things you can do much better than I did by starting early. So that was all my advice and lessons.

413
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,220
If I knew this in my second year,

414
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,680
I would prepare myself so well that I couldn't fail.

415
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,440
So yeah, that is my lessons and advices.

416
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
Thank you for listening.

417
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,640
Thank you, Yujun, that's very helpful.

418
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,400
And I think, you know, what's really impressive

419
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,539
is how genuine you are in sharing your thoughts and experience. And it's really encouraging

420
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,559
to people who are who might be having second doubts about themselves. You know, before

421
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:45,240
people in the audience, feel free to ask questions or type in your questions.

422
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,400
But we've had a couple coming in.

423
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,519
And I feel like because your experience is so broad,

424
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,400
people might ask all sorts of questions.

425
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,440
And it could be loosely categorized

426
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,640
into your experience as an economist,

427
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,599
and then having startups yourselves,

428
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,180
and then transitioning into a

429
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,279
data scientist and now you know having your own YouTube channel and then some

430
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,640
people might just want some general advice for you so let's try to maybe

431
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:26,000
group our questions in this kind of categories. Anyone wants to be the first person asking a question live?

432
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Hello?

433
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Hello?

434
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Hi Fumi, we can hear you. So, would you advise to someone who is interested in going to the

435
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
industry later to

436
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
start

437
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
a

438
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
video sharing, because that's the rule we said for q&a if you

439
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
want to ask a question like

440
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
was the rule. Yeah, there's a rule for q&a if you want to ask

441
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
in person is better to just share a video.

442
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,319
Oh to turn on the video. Right. Yeah, there's a rule for Q&A. If you want to ask in person, it's better to just share

443
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,319
a video.

444
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,559
Oh, to turn on the video?

445
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,559
Right.

446
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,559
Oh,

447
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,559
unnecessary.

448
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,559
All right.

449
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,559
Sorry, I didn't prepare.

450
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,559
Okay. Yeah, feel free.

451
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:26,960
Okay. Would it be better to try to finish the PhD faster or

452
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,320
utilize the summer to do internships? And how would you

453
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,000
compare the problems in financial markets to consumer

454
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,639
markets? Two questions.

455
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,800
Yeah, the first one I think is easy, but I didn't get the

456
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,199
second one. So I'll ask for clarification. The first one, like, internship is ready

457
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,599
to try out right and build a resume. If you have a good

458
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,559
enough resume, and if you know what you need to do, then just

459
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,800
finish a PhD and do that. But if you don't, then definitely, you

460
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,440
know, try as many internships and until you, you have a good

461
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,000
enough resume

462
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,000
to do the things you know you want to do.

463
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,800
The second question, financial markets

464
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,039
and the consumer markets,

465
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,039
is it choosing between the industry or?

466
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,099
Are the problems similar or different?

467
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,340
The promise?

468
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,400
Are the problems similar or different. Oh, okay, I guess it's about how did I apply my knowledge of a finance PhD like economics concentrated in finance to consumer markets, right? A lot of tools and skills can be carried over. For example, I did apply econometrics.

469
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I did causal inference for the corporate finance study.

470
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,480
For example, matching, difference in difference,

471
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,000
all those causal inference stuff.

472
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,280
And those tools can be directly applied

473
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,039
to solve

474
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,860
consumer markets problems. That's why Amazon hired me to

475
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,519
do or what they hired me to do. But again, going back to not

476
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:20,079
limiting myself, I guess I didn't. This reminds me I

477
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,599
didn't I promised to talk about the difference between data

478
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:29,079
scientists and economics and forgot to do that. Like, it

479
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,840
doesn't like, what drives me is to solve problems and create

480
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,800
impact. And it doesn't take complicated model to solve

481
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,679
problems. In a lot of cases, if the problem is worth stopping,

482
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,280
like comparing the two means or or you know, finding where the problem is, is much more

483
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,719
important than being able to build sophisticated models. Of

484
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:54,840
course, there are problems that needs to be solved by

485
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:00,119
sophisticated models. And I'm also like, mildly interested in

486
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:07,440
doing that. But that is not that is not how I

487
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,599
think about my career. When I think about my career is not

488
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,119
about how to apply my past knowledge. It's about what

489
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:21,719
problems excites me. So I guess to some to some, some of the

490
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:27,639
skills are transferable. But the domain knowledge, for example, is definitely not relevant. And

491
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,000
yeah, I don't feel sorry for that.

492
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,000
Right, thank you. Anyone else got a question?

493
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
Can everyone help me?

494
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,159
Yes. Anyone else got a question? Can everyone hear me?

495
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,440
Yes.

496
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,719
Hi, I'm Ma Chen.

497
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:50,239
I have one question about the stop.

498
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,559
So I'm curious what happened to your stop in the end?

499
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,639
Oh, we closed College Grocery when we took off,

500
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,599
because it's actually a very heavy operation.

501
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,280
It takes a lot of operations.

502
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,920
For example, you have to do customer service, you had to maintain a good

503
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,320
relationship with the grocery store. If you get one kind of

504
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,840
vinegar, but they're out of stock, do you replace or do you

505
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,079
refund? There are a lot of like tricky, like things that takes

506
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:31,599
time and nobody was willing to do that after I left so we're just gonna see and but I'm still operating in New York City I hope the pandemic didn't

507
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,440
didn't make them bankrupt but they had three I think

508
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,800
shops in New York City. Okay I see see. Yeah, so I have a second question

509
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,300
which is a little personal.

510
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,280
So what's the intensive when you decided to

511
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:55,320
like build up a startup?

512
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,840
Is it to try to make a lot of money

513
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,000
or like just a random decision to try different things?

514
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,920
Yeah, good question.

515
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Because that's actually my motivation

516
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,400
for doing a lot of things, including

517
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,440
start a YouTube channel.

518
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,800
It's not, it's never about the money.

519
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,599
It's just about seeing a problem and I want to solve it.

520
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,880
And I have a huge, like a big drive to solve the problem.

521
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,000
The startup started because I go to New York City quite often.

522
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,079
And every time I go there, people ask me,

523
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,800
can you bring us some grocery bag?

524
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,480
I'm willing to pay you like 50% above the recipe,

525
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,760
like the price.

526
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,719
And I said, OK, there is a real demand.

527
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,000
Let's try to solve it.

528
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,639
And that's how I started.

529
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,039
We started with a Google form

530
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,960
and then turn into a Wix website

531
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,239
and then turn into a Shopify website.

532
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,920
In retrospect, it's actually helped

533
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,960
a lot of my current experiences

534
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,119
because Facebook is doing the Facebook shops with Shopify.

535
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,440
And my experiences of running a Shopify store

536
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,940
actually helped me understand

537
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,760
a lot of

538
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,239
e-commerce business in general, but that was never the plan. I see, thank you.

539
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah, may I ask one question?

540
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,679
Okay, thank you, Yujun. I'm also a PhD student in economics. So I know that Amazon has already

541
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:35,679
established the economics team, while Facebook is resting new in building its economics team.

542
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,800
So I'm curious that how do you feel about working in this two companies? Do you feel

543
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,760
more like familiar in Amazon environment compared to Facebook?

544
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,639
There are two very different companies, even though they are intact. Also, there is more

545
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,239
difference between Facebook and Amazon, and between Amazon and BCG even. And I don't think

546
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:05,679
Facebook is going to hire a lot of economists to do the economics economist because at Facebook, it provides

547
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,840
a free product. They can run a B testing for almost everything.

548
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,199
And Amazon hires economics mostly to do causal inference.

549
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,559
But Facebook can do a B testing. So don't they don't need to do

550
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:27,559
this. But my training of economics PhD helped me to I guess the training is helpful. I

551
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,599
also have a very short video about this. It forced me to

552
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,239
think about equilibrium, I think about marginal, and when you

553
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,159
solve problem at tech companies, you'll find a lot of people,

554
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,199
they focus on the first order effect of your policy. For

555
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:48,760
example, if you set a price for right, it will make people sell more expensive stuff. But they

556
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,519
didn't think about the substitution effect, or the

557
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,800
incoming factor, whatever they don't care about, they didn't

558
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,320
think about the second order problem. And a lot of the time,

559
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,800
the second, the second order impact is more important. So I

560
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,900
guess the training of economics PhD, if

561
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,380
you have the sufficient tech skill, like if you can write a

562
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,380
SQL well, if you can do analysis fast, if you can do data

563
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,760
manipulation in Python, then combined with our economics

564
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:25,000
degree is quite welcomed at any company, consulting or tech.

565
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,800
But yeah, like don't expect other tech companies

566
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,139
to hire economists as Amazon does.

567
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,659
Yeah.

568
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:39,820
Thank you.

569
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,460
I have a related question on that actually.

570
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,719
When I first joined McKinsey,

571
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,559
I actually spent three months working

572
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,360
on the data science project.

573
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,119
And my role was what they call a data translator.

574
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,039
So our project was around something that's got to do

575
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,559
with clinical and pharmaceutical applications

576
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,760
of data science.

577
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,239
And we had half of our team,

578
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,000
pure data scientists and data engineers, and the other half people with a medical

579
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,760
degree or a PhD in biological sciences. So I'm wondering that

580
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,559
you know, outside of maybe, you know, consulting related data

581
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,159
science projects in the real data science industry, is there

582
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,599
a need for this kind of roles of people who may not be coding,

583
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,119
but they know something about data science to translate the

584
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,639
business or clinical or consumer aspect of the industry.

585
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:46,360
Yes, but okay, so the, the world of consulting is pretty different

586
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,079
than a lot of tech. And related to a question in this way,

587
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,199
consulting deals with a lot of companies, right? They don't

588
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,639
necessarily have the expertise to understand those complex

589
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,639
analysis or complex research. So they need a translator. In tech,

590
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,960
everyone should know tech, like, they have a very high hiring

591
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,800
bar for BA engineers or product manager. So everyone knows their

592
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,400
shit, basically. They don't need a translator to translate

593
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,639
otherwise they will just fail at their job, because that's the expectation to know

594
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:34,840
their stuff. That being said, said, like, for example, people

595
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,440
in business function to don't necessarily that did not do not

596
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,960
necessarily well versed in, in models, for example, they

597
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,719
understand was the difference between correlation and

598
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:51,579
causation. They know to get this, you have to overcome

599
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,800
selection bias. They know, you know, on a very high level what

600
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,199
machine learning can do and cannot do. But sometimes if you

601
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,960
want to, for example, translate to a devised mean and like a

602
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,840
normal mean, how does, translate a devised mean and like a normal mean,

603
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,559
how does that translate into business impact? They don't know that. They don't have that

604
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:20,800
knowledge for granted. So I guess in order to be successful in tech as a PhD,

605
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,639
knowing, have the domain expertise and have the

606
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,039
knowledge, the skill is important. But being able to

607
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:34,159
communicate to a way that most people, like engineers and PMs,

608
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,719
you can expect them to have a certain type of level of

609
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:40,599
knowledge, but not as sophisticated as sophisticated

610
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:44,719
as you are. Being able to communicate is also important.

611
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,440
sophisticated as you are, being able to communicate is also important. So that is a skill. That is not a type of job that

612
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,440
is more of a skill that you, you should have in order to be

613
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,559
successful, to be successful.

614
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,840
So my question is that as a PhD of economics, you have all the backgrounds of the economics and aesthetics. So the job for a

615
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,400
consultant is kind of like fit for you, because you have all

616
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,920
the knowledge is so as a consultant, you have to have

617
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,920
a lot of knowledge of economics, and you have to have a lot of

618
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,000
knowledge of economics fit for you

619
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,099
because you have all the knowledges.

620
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:32,599
So as an engineering student as me,

621
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:34,960
I don't have a lot of economics background.

622
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,960
So do you have any advice for me to get some resources,

623
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:47,659
to get those knowledges to prepare for the, you know, future consultant or, you know, potential jobs at

624
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,039
these kind of fields.

625
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:55,840
Good question. So the, my friend who prepared me for my interview is a

626
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,559
biochemistry PhD.

627
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,000
The first consultant I worked with is a mechanical engineering PhD.

628
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I will say there are less social science PhD at consultant than there are engineering or science PhDs.

629
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:28,280
So, and when I did the consulting interview, they didn't care about my economics background, to care about how I performed in case interviews, to care about how my business sense but they

630
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,599
didn't care about my degree. And a lot of times I think having a

631
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,840
sense of hard science background gives you the extra edge because

632
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:44,039
you can actually understand the hard problems that your clients

633
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,400
are facing. So

634
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,920
for example, if your client is a auto manufacturer, then being a

635
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,480
mechanical engineer and PhD is a very good boost.

636
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,480
So thanks. So is there a fundamental like requirement to

637
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:05,280
So is there a fundamental like requirement to, to, you know,

638
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,400
let the HR think, oh, you are at least being able to understand those economics fundamentals? Is there a class I need to take or

639
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,920
you advise me to take for the

640
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,519
internship is the best way to signal that you are qualified to

641
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,840
HR. So get a PTA, get an internship at a second tier

642
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,199
consulting company, like get a get the best internship,

643
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,079
you can get. That's how to HR.

644
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,840
I see. Thanks.

645
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,400
I guess I can follow up on this question. So for me personally,

646
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,239
I'm considering a transfer future goal is to start a

647
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:49,239
startup. But there are basically a lot of traffic, a lot

648
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:53,079
of ways I can take to achieve that goal. So right now I'm

649
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:58,039
thinking about two sense. The first way is to enter consulting

650
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:01,039
for a couple of years, build out my connections, and then use

651
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,920
that connections and resources to help me to build a successful

652
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,760
startup.

653
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,579
A second, but this actually one of the sense,

654
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:13,079
in the previous talk, the previous speaker was really,

655
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,239
he doesn't like this idea,

656
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,000
cause he's running startups.

657
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,840
And he will recommend that instead of going to consulting,

658
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,239
I should consider going into joining a startup directly.

659
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,079
So how do you compare these two different chats if my future

660
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,800
goal is to build a company?

661
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:39,440
So I think that there are too many variables in that decision.

662
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,280
Like for example, if you know the startup is going to be

663
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,039
successful, then do that. But I guess that's the uncertainty, right? So the safe

664
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,599
path is to join industry, build our experience and you know,

665
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,079
take the challenge when you feel you need to or see for you to

666
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:05,800
or when it is, it's like a hood of success is like, but I guess

667
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,840
different people have just different risk appetite and

668
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,440
different expertise. So I don't know how I can give her a

669
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,079
condition. Okay.

670
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,079
Excuse me.

671
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Excuse me. I have a question. Yeah.

672
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:47,860
I'm curious about, like, you're as a senior data scientist, I'm curious about what the most important techniques or tools you are using in your daily work. I wonder if there's any gaps between the just for the data science and then a gap

673
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:52,019
between the industry and lab, because I'm working on some like

674
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:56,019
a very complicated deep learning or machine learning models. I'm

675
00:50:56,139 --> 00:51:01,719
I'm more I'm curious if that is useful in your real work

676
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:02,380
industry.

677
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,239
Yes, yes, very.

678
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:08,199
So I guess my two different jobs, right?

679
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,440
Facebook, what I do is I run SQL to get data

680
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,800
and I use Tableau to plot the data

681
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,480
and I use PPT to present the data.

682
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,320
That's almost it.

683
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,800
And then I write docs.

684
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,400
I guess the writing training I received at PhD

685
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,039
was actually quite useful.

686
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,920
I'm able to produce high quality notes. It's almost like a mini research

687
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,760
paper. It's a good speed. So that helped me to land a lot of

688
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,880
impact. I sometimes use Python to do data cleaning and do some

689
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,440
simple analysis models. But I often use Tableau because the

690
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,460
problem just requires Tableau to solve. A-B testing is a must at Facebook,

691
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,260
being able to do causal inference based on A-B testing,

692
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:55,300
design the experiment, also data are not contaminated, all those

693
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:03,659
things are a must. At Amazon, I use Spark, Python, mostly

694
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:06,440
because the infrastructure at Amazon is

695
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,920
not as good as Facebook. So how to get the data I have to

696
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,159
basically set up the machines, the servers to get the data and

697
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,840
build the data pipeline, clean the data, and then use Python to

698
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,559
to run some. What I did is synthetic cohort and measures

699
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,360
completion so simple, simple machine learning models, not And what I did is synthetic cohort and measures completion.

700
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,920
So simple machine learning models, not deep learning

701
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,920
models, to draw causal inference based on big data set.

702
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,920
But I feel like if you can code deep learning model,

703
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,320
all the tech requirements should be easy.

704
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,039
It's just about preparing for the interview, shopping or communication. And we have a

705
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,000
video up incoming to talk about that.

706
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:52,880
Yeah, thank you.

707
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:03,199
Hi. Can you hear me? Okay. So thank you for your presentation

708
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:09,000
and your insight so far. And I'm currently a master's student. And my

709
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,360
question is about getting a job in the US after after having a

710
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:21,440
PhD degree. And so as far as I know, in some countries, such as

711
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:30,480
in Germany, sometimes getting a PhD degree is not a good thing because sometimes

712
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:38,719
the companies think that you are overqualified for the job and sometimes they don't want to

713
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:50,960
hire you because they will need to pay you more as compared to a master or a bachelor degree holder and so sometimes you know

714
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,880
having a PhD degree makes you less competitive for the job. So my question is can you tell me

715
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:07,440
the situation in the US? I mean can you give me some insight of like, having

716
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:14,599
a is like, is getting a PhD degree is a good thing. And it

717
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:20,960
helps you to to easier finding a job in the US. Yeah, thank you.

718
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,639
It's my question.

719
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:28,519
Yeah, so that's my, my first advice is not to answer questions to don't get a PhD. If

720
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,119
if our purpose is just to boost our job competitive, like if, if

721
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:38,079
your purpose is to make it easier to apply for a job. Don't

722
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,960
get don't get into PhD PhD is designed for research for

723
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,599
academia, like we happen to be trained well to be able to do other

724
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,800
things. But if you don't like research or academia, it's very

725
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,119
difficult to survive. Like I found it difficult to survive

726
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:59,599
myself, even though I liked every piece of my research and

727
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,719
the reading papers, I was able to just study like do research

728
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:09,420
like for months without doing anything else. But even that was not a

729
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,099
pleasant experience. So it's not worth it to, you know, to spend

730
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,099
five years in PhD just to be able to increase our likelihood

731
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,639
of getting a job. I feel like if you apply to an internship, and

732
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,960
you know, climb up the corporate ladder or whatever, it's much easier.

733
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,440
No, but yeah.

734
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,440
And I guess the relative competition,

735
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:36,480
or like, is it easier for PhDs to get jobs?

736
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,099
I think yes, because most of my PhD friends,

737
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:42,639
if they want to go to industry,

738
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,519
if they want to find a job, they can always do that. I haven't seen industry, if they want to find a job, they can always do that.

739
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,920
I haven't seen one case that they want to find a job but they couldn't.

740
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,880
Even if they couldn't stay in the United States, they can easily find a job back home.

741
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,360
Yeah, so one more quick question is that you think that the ranking of the university is a

742
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,360
of the university is a critical point, I mean, an important point in finding a job.

743
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,519
I mean, do the HR people will pay a lot of attention

744
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,719
to the ranking?

745
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:13,800
Yes.

746
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,800
OK.

747
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,440
Industry, yes.

748
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,000
Thank you.

749
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,519
Hey, I have a question.

750
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:26,239
So you just said that you are actually

751
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:28,199
very interested in academia and very

752
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:30,039
used to the lifestyle there.

753
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:33,760
But it's still difficult to survive academia.

754
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,519
I wonder, is that that difficult?

755
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,760
I mean, because you graduated from Cornell.

756
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:48,480
And if you want to go into academia, you can do that, right? I mean, so I'm just and also if you like, actually,

757
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:51,559
like, like from your description of your past PhD life, I feel

758
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:57,119
like, yeah, I feel like you're like, it's very simple, like,

759
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,920
like, I just wonder why you change the path, like, you know,

760
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:03,079
thanks.

761
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,800
If you want to be successful in academia, it's not impossible to

762
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:15,159
do. I guess it's not it's not very hard to do as well. Or like,

763
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,719
if you want to survive, it's not hard to do if you want to do

764
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:22,800
well, it's difficult, but it's still possible. My choice was

765
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,000
more related to that, you know, I just, I

766
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,480
realized, academia is not my passion. I'm passionate about a

767
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,079
very small part of it. The part of, you know, into being

768
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:38,199
intellectually challenged, solve the questions nobody have

769
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:41,760
solved before, like those parts, but I didn't like, you know,

770
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:45,760
rewriting the paper a hundred times,

771
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,780
going through a referee process, you know,

772
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,880
discussing all the like detail that nobody care about

773
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,559
in seminars or with our peers.

774
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,019
All those things were like very painful to me.

775
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,480
And that was not my passion.

776
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,159
I feel like I can, like for example,

777
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,579
consulting is a great place to find

778
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:08,639
the same intellectual challenge,

779
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,679
but solve problem that people actually care about.

780
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:13,860
Yeah.

781
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:15,719
I see, thank you.

782
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:40,519
Great, any other questions from the audience?

783
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,119
I think I see that there is a debate in the chat box about the requirement for advanced

784
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:50,360
degree in the necessity of it if you were to go to industry.

785
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,639
I think the clarification that we need to make here is if you think about different

786
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:02,960
career options on the spectrum and you know you rank it whether it's further away from

787
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,000
repure research or closer.

788
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,519
And I would probably put industry jobs

789
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:10,539
as on the closer end of the spectrum

790
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:14,079
to your actual research and maybe consulting banking

791
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,360
or VC on the other spectrum.

792
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,679
And there's another dimension,

793
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,519
which is also the requirement of specific knowledge

794
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:26,480
and expertise, and that's kind of the reverse to the spectrum.

795
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,480
So maybe you probably don't 100% need a PhD

796
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,679
to go to industry, but you probably need a master's

797
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:39,579
or related undergraduate degree.

798
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,800
And to be honest, I would say higher percentage

799
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,000
would require a related advanced degree.

800
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But if you go to the other spectrum, if you were to go into banking, consulting, or anything else, it's completely not a requirement at all.

801
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:06,199
In that case, they will probably put more weight on other factors on your CV, such as your, you know, the ranking of your university, the diversity of your extracurricular

802
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:09,000
and any other passion you've shown

803
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,099
for their industry or sector?

804
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,719
Yeah, that's a good summary.

805
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,679
Like, I guess the one end of the spectrum

806
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,300
is being a professor, right?

807
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,320
You 100% need a PhD.

808
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:27,840
And being a researcher, probably a PhD will help. But I guess the previous question is about, you

809
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,239
know, if I want to apply for a job, is PhD going to help me

810
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,960
make it be more successful? If you want to be a professor or a

811
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,199
researcher, you wouldn't ask this question, because you know,

812
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:44,559
you need a PhD. So it's also, I guess, my answer was to the case

813
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,000
that a PhD is an option, but not a necessity.

814
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So how should you choose and my advice is don't do it.

815
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's not worth it.

816
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I have a question.

817
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,159
I have one more question on the data science career of yours.

818
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:07,079
Because a lot of people around me

819
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,280
seem to be wanting to be a data scientist.

820
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,719
Actually, everyone wants to be a data scientist nowadays.

821
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,039
And a lot of them have zero background in anything related.

822
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,199
They're probably in bioinformatics,

823
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:23,960
or in physics, or even chemistry.

824
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,679
So I wanted to know from people around you who are proper

825
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:33,360
data scientists, what is their background? How many people are actually from non-computer science,

826
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:43,760
non-math, non-economics background? And what do we see are kind of subjects or topics or

827
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,440
of subjects or, or, you know, topics or kind of their PhD

828
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,039
areas that could be a higher likelihood for them to enter

829
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,800
data science.

830
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:03,039
So first, data science is not a high bar. If a PhD have done quantitative research, whether psychology, a PhD or physics,

831
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,400
PhD, their skill skill

832
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,239
set is good enough for data scientist, because data

833
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,079
scientists is about application and about solving problems,

834
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:17,719
analytics application and solving problems. It's not about

835
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,559
building the most sophisticated models, right. And they actually

836
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:28,440
like companies hire specifically for machine learning engineers, research scientists or apply

837
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,360
scientists, that you know, go and build models and solve the

838
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,679
cutting edge artificial problems in artificial intelligence. For

839
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:39,760
example, how to make Amazon's recommendation system better.

840
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:45,159
That requires specific domain knowledge. But for format for my current role,

841
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,960
data scientists, as I said, like, second, second year,

842
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:56,920
second, like sophomore, sophomore level of statistic in

843
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,960
college, not in PhD, is enough to handle most cases. So if you

844
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,400
had done quality quantitative research,

845
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:17,039
you have the skill set. Yeah, like, forgot what the question was. Did that answer the question?

846
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:27,400
Yes. Yeah, like, most PhDs, they're qualified. It's just about the experience and

847
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:35,079
interview. So get your resume to pass the HR stage and then prepare to interview so the hiring manager hires you.

848
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:40,159
Thank you.

849
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:49,159
Okay, like I might have a question, like you mentioned that it would be much better if

850
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:58,320
you could have started preparing for a job like searching at the second year of your

851
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,320
PhD.

852
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:08,400
But my question is that like usually like a lot of research takes a long time, much more than two years

853
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,480
to even get on track.

854
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:17,880
So what's your suggestion on determining what's the starting point?

855
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:24,320
Because I discussed with some of my friends on when to decide it is the time to quit or

856
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,400
to continue. Like my idea is more like maybe it is more about

857
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,480
rewarding you have like the more rewarding your rewards you have

858
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,840
during your PhD as a academic research and then probably we

859
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,199
will continue more on this trend. I guess at this past on

860
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,519
like, I just want to hear about

861
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:52,960
like your thoughts on when to decide on the on your past.

862
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,280
Yeah, thank you.

863
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:02,280
Yeah. So, I guess I need to clarify, that was my own lesson

864
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:08,360
and what I would have done differently if I started again, everyone's situation is different from my

865
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:14,599
advice is no interest, no, no, strength and no self basically,

866
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,559
and then make the decision based on our own scenario, not mine.

867
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:23,800
Right. And but for me, the reason I said I wanted to do to

868
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,119
start in my second year is, of course, like my research would take a long

869
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:32,960
time to build. But I stayed six years, I wanted to do acting, I

870
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,280
had the counterfactual right had wanted to do acting, I stayed

871
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,559
those years, but I wasn't particularly proud of my

872
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:44,039
research paper. It is an important topic, I think is

873
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:49,800
research paper, like it is an important topic, I think is a nicely written paper, but there was no impact. And because what

874
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,920
drives me is impact, right? So I don't care. Like, if I, if I

875
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,920
stay in my PhD for four years and had a much crappy paper,

876
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:01,960
much crappier paper, I would actually be happier today. So

877
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,659
that's why I said, if I do it again,

878
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:08,519
I would start in my second year.

879
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:10,000
But I know everyone's different.

880
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,719
So definitely today just make a decision

881
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,159
based on our own scenario.

882
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,039
Yeah, thank you.

883
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,000
Yeah, thanks.

884
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,159
I guess to follow up on that,

885
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:27,119
Yujun, is there a moment in your current life where you think back, you say, okay, if I were to follow up on that, you john, is there a moment, you know, current life, we will think back, you say, Okay, if I

886
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,599
were to continue and Damian, maybe, you know, I will be a

887
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,639
professor. You have no, so you have no moments of regret,

888
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:34,880
right?

889
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,880
Just, of course, it's not helpful to regret things. Like,

890
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,280
like I said, I'll do HR, I'll do it differently.

891
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:52,440
But I that is more as a device for like this people who are in

892
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,840
a PhD program. If I choose my life, I wouldn't necessarily

893
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,760
want to do it all over again, because I got I'm happy with my

894
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,639
current life, right? So everything that leads to my

895
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:07,280
current life, I think, you know, that they're

896
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,639
good. I don't have any particular regrets. And it took

897
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:15,400
me six years to realize I wasn't in leukemia. Maybe that's,

898
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:20,280
that's what I need. If I change my decision in my second year,

899
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:25,159
maybe I will always have self doubt, you know, what, then maybe I'll have

900
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:27,599
questions, like you just mentioned, you know, what, what,

901
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:31,400
what if today I don't have what if because I suffered those six

902
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,559
years and I realized, you know, that's not my passion. Okay,

903
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:36,599
that's a good point.

904
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:47,280
And of the jobs you did, I know you had experience startup things, some experience in consulting, and now data

905
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,000
scientists, what is the job you like most, or you, the bet on

906
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:54,920
using the best is yet to come. So what you know what I was

907
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,760
thinking right now,

908
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,519
on my current job. Otherwise, I would have like, so I guess some

909
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:08,800
some data points to back my kind of, you know, my, my current job. Otherwise, I would have like, so I guess some some data points

910
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,039
to back my claim. Amazon has a very particular stock vesting

911
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:16,880
schedule. So when you go to a tech company, they give you

912
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,560
stocks for four years. But Amazon the first year it was 5%,

913
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,600
second year 15%, third and fourth 40% each. And when I

914
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,520
joined Amazon, Amazon stock was at 800 something. Now it's at

915
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,760
3000. So I was actually underpaid in Facebook, when I

916
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:40,119
took the Facebook job. And so I get paid less at Facebook than

917
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:45,680
I was at Amazon. But I wanted to try the job so I can like if

918
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,039
I'm not happy at Facebook, I would go to another job.

919
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,520
Great. Any other questions from the audience?

920
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,000
I guess we have a lot of comments in the chat box. I try to speak because I cannot.

921
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Yeah, yeah, I was muted.

922
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,279
I have a two buttons need to unmute so I'm mute one and the other still muted so you

923
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,000
can hear me now.

924
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Okay, so I put some text comments because previously I got some technical problems to unmute both.

925
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It's good, it's good communication we can talk more. So, so today, like I put in the comments, things are changing.

926
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,300
Like 20, 30 years ago, if I had PhD,

927
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,899
the industry labs will value you more,

928
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:53,760
but today can be different.

929
01:09:57,979 --> 01:10:02,899
Yeah, I'm looking at the discussion in the chats.

930
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:06,000
I think there are two things I want to address.

931
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:12,479
One is like still like we focus on the job that requires a PhD.

932
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,399
So if you are a PhD, you know, that is our advantage because

933
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:20,960
this jobs. You all have a comparative advantage of being a

934
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:27,640
PhD. So as a PhD definitely focus on those jobs or not focus but you know, pay more attention to those

935
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:32,159
jobs and apply and you'll be successful. I don't know the

936
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:37,319
future, but at least you know, darker jobs. But the second is,

937
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:44,319
like, for example, a lot of big companies have to do research,

938
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:52,279
of big companies have to do research, they have their research department. Yes. And, but don't take industry job as

939
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:57,840
an escape, we cannot do academia well. Like, for example, the

940
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:06,840
Google AI or Facebook AI research. Those are the, they hire the best PhDs, right. So,

941
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,439
like, if you want to get into the right, very good, the

942
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:18,079
promising industry research career, you need to be very good

943
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:22,439
at academia, research and creation research that actually

944
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:25,000
has an impact. So I

945
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:33,680
guess those are my two points.

946
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:44,239
Yeah, is the AI is a unique area because the company like a Google, Amazon, they tried to hire the best AI scientists

947
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,880
develop the most advanced

948
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:51,239
algorithms. But to develop the AI applications that need or

949
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:52,760
desire to have PhDs.

950
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,039
Yeah, and I talked about that in my YouTube channel as well. I

951
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:01,119
feel like a lot of industry application of machine learning

952
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:03,680
is actually an engineering problem, not a science problem.

953
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,680
You don't need to develop algorithm to do that.

954
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,119
You just need to apply the Python packages to solve, you

955
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:13,359
need you need to define the problem, they need to apply the

956
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:15,520
right Python packages to solve it.

957
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,680
Does anyone have any follow up questions?

958
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:27,600
Yeah, we're at the final question. Okay, yeah, so the final one. Yeah.

959
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,479
Thank you for the topic. Very sensory content is your personal

960
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:41,039
experience. So my first, can you hear me. Just to confirm. Okay,

961
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,239
confirm. Okay, so my question is, after that, that's yet after this year's PhD, everyone wants to have that game more from the

962
01:12:55,279 --> 01:13:00,239
PhD experience. But right now you choose to go through the

963
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:04,960
industry and compete with the master student and some

964
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,359
undergraduate students. Some of them are your boss right now. to the industry and compete with the master's students and some

965
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:10,159
undergraduate students. Some of them are your boss right now. So

966
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:17,920
how do you how do you take this situation? How do you

967
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:28,319
accept someone is someone with only a master's degree guide to is your boss

968
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,840
right now.

969
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:35,079
I didn't capture the kind of type maybe.

970
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:39,640
So I think he was asking. So right now we enter industry for

971
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,520
example, in Facebook, or for example, if your boss, he only

972
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,119
has a master's degree, how do you feel about that?

973
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,239
What's that meritocracy? Yeah, like, the PhD doesn't tell you

974
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:58,199
you are better. Having a PhD just is a certification that

975
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:00,920
you're completing a PhD program. It doesn't mean you're better

976
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,439
than a master. So I guess if your boss is better than you

977
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:07,239
listen to him, your idea is better than him, you try to convince him your

978
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:14,680
idea is better. But I don't view the title, like the title. The

979
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,199
title doesn't shouldn't mean anything.

980
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,680
Okay, thank you.

981
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,840
Yes, I guess. So we are coming to one half hours, and I really appreciate you john to take this opportunity to share the

982
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,960
advice with Oh, there any other comment.

983
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,000
Looks like there's another question. So this is definitely

984
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,640
the last one. So I can paraphrase. So he was asking, I

985
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,560
don't know if the competition between China and the US would

986
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,000
inspire my investments to fundamental fundamental

987
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,760
research. What is the take on that seem like right right now

988
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,640
this is a trend.

989
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,199
I don't know. And I don't care like, what can I do to change

990
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:10,920
that? No. So yeah,

991
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:16,279
