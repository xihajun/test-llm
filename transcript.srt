00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Hey, welcome. Thanks. Yeah. YZ. Welcome to my channel. So Nick is a master sommelier

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,039
that I met how many years ago? Three years ago? I think three years ago. And we became friends. Yes.

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:19,120
Through drinking wine and playing poker. That's right. We have shared some great bottles and

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,960
good games. Yeah. I do feel like whenever I have wine, my poker game suffers. Me too.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
But that's okay. And you've introduced me to a lot of good food too.

6
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh yeah. And we had some business collaborations together.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nick was doing wine consulting and all this.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Buying and selling wine, training wine, selection wine, catering.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So today I want to interview you kind of about your take as a master sommelier in the field.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,679
field so I want to just listen to your opinions of what do you think wine is about.

11
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,400
So you know for those who are less familiar with the Master Sommelier program it basically

12
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:22,280
encompasses the world of wine, also spirits, beer, sake, baijiu and I have done intensive

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,679
studies to learn about these beverages and am now one of maybe close to 300 in the world.

14
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,759
So in a way I'm in a very select group and an expert, but I also look around at other

15
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:23,320
friends who aren't even in the Master Sommelier program with knowledge and business skills

16
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,420
and things that just make me look like a beginner.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
How do those friends view you?

18
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,759
That's a question though because I find myself actually envious sometimes of these guys are

19
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,279
drinking these wines and I'm sure plenty of people could look at me and be envious and

20
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:20,879
it's this thing that I think any professional person has to deal with.

21
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,339
You know let's say you're the CEO of Honda, are you then going to be jealous of the CEO

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of Tesla or of GM.

23
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,160
You know, so it's these top achievers sort of looking at each other.

24
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,519
But I feel like that's not only in the professions or in the business.

25
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:23,600
Just as anyone, you can always compare yourself to someone else at some dimension and you

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
find someone who is better or that you are invest of.

27
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
But I guess the motivation of growing, improving

28
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,160
comes from looking inward.

29
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,079
You feel satisfied or motivated doing the work every day.

30
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,600
What motivates you to do the work

31
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
is a love of the passion about the beverages

32
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,519
instead of I need to be better than someone else.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Well, and that's a vision that I've been trying to cultivate is, you know, it's very easy

34
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,740
to compare to others, but ultimately, like, my biggest supporter and biggest adversary

35
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,619
is myself.

36
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:22,859
Because I have so many visions and ideas of what I want to accomplish that there's no

37
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,019
comparing to what anyone else is doing.

38
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,480
It's all my own world.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
And I think my specialist, my specialty in a way is the selection that I've been building

40
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:16,480
here is one of the most representative selections of wine styles of around the world.

41
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,239
Versus some other peers might be like Bordeaux specialists and be very deep in that area.

42
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,160
I have in the cellar right now at least a thousand different types of wine.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,019
And with all those styles combined, I feel like I have types from every important wine

44
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:09,839
region in the world, and I'm even finding new ones all the time.

45
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,720
So that's what I take pride in.

46
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
All right.

47
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,000
I think I have two kinds of questions or two thesis of questions.

48
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,559
First is this style, this world style, right?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,719
When you select a region and you find the representative bottle of representative variety,

50
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,400
what do you mean by being representative?

51
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,359
A thousand bottles seems like a lot, but compared to all the bottles out there, it's a very

52
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,359
small proportion.

53
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,000
Then how do you choose one variety versus the hundreds that you didn't choose?

54
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,160
I guess that's number one.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
And thesis number two is to talk about your vision and your ideas.

56
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,919
Probably this vision and ideas arise from your observation or your experience, you know,

57
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,400
something is lacking, there is a problem you want to solve, or there is a value you want

58
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,399
to create, right?

59
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,780
Or there is a demand you want to fulfill.

60
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,920
So if you care to share some of those visions.

61
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,539
So in thinking about classic styles from around the world, I think something that might be

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,019
considered a classic is within wine a particular region often has grape

63
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:10,160
varieties that are historic to that place so maybe it's Pinot Noir in

64
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,420
Burgundy or Tempranillo in Spain but then going in even deeper there's areas

65
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,120
where there are grape varieties that aren't made anywhere else so in Italy we

66
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:29,500
see Biancolela in Lazio or in Argentina we see Bernarda and I'm super

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,839
interested in these very unique little corners of the world and it actually makes me feel

68
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,560
connected to the whole world through these little unique points.

69
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,980
It's almost like you go to a local, you visit somewhere and there is a place that sells

70
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,320
local produce that you cannot get anywhere else.

71
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,519
But I guess for one, luckily for us, you can import and we can drink at home.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
We don't have to visit that special place, but in this way we feel connected too.

73
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, by opening the bottle it transports us to that place for a short amount of time.

74
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I feel like there needs to be an education behind each Schofield bottle.

75
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh sure.

76
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If I buy some special one from some special region, if I don't know, then I'm missing

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
out a lot of the special connection or the, yeah, just the experience behind the wine,

78
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
I guess.

79
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,039
I feel like my work is a lot like a DJ.

80
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,280
And I have many genres here.

81
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,920
It's not just classical, it's not just jazz.

82
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,199
You know, I have a few songs from every genre you could think of.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,879
I feel like you are a DJ in a music history class.

84
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,980
Yeah, but I, so if I'm only going to have,

85
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,619
let's say five reggae songs in the cellar,

86
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,359
I want them to be the best.

87
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,199
The best.

88
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,480
You have to have Bob Marley.

89
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,879
But then you can have some modern

90
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,440
kind of new versions as well.

91
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
I see.

92
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,920
But I'm very interested in having the classics

93
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,039
juxtaposed against some modern styles as well.

94
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,859
I see.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
And over the time, the wine list you build,

96
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,919
the selection you have in here becomes very special.

97
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,000
It's your selection and it represents your take

98
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,560
on what is the best and what is worthy

99
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,559
of being represented, I guess being, yeah, worthy.

100
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,839
It becomes more than just individual bottles.

101
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,039
The collection itself, to me, has a personality.

102
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:26,879
Nice.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
this this kind of library or catalog in itself it reflects my creativity.

104
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Okay.

105
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,199
What's really neat about a lot of the wines that I have is that I may have the last, it's

106
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,440
like the last dinosaur, I may have the last of a certain kind of wine in the whole country.

107
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,559
And I think that's super cool.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
everything in here I find to be of superior taste as well. Something that

109
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,080
would be enjoyable for me any day of the week.

110
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Okay, let's dig into that a little bit. Because when people, like newbies like me,

111
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,679
when we look into a wine, we don't know a lot of the history or the

112
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,600
making, the processing of the wine. We are seeking that education but

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
we don't have enough knowledge.

114
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,360
So the first two things I guess we think about

115
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,720
is the price and how it tastes.

116
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,759
So apparently you select the wine

117
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,079
that you think tastes well, right?

118
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,640
But how do you judge?

119
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,719
Because for example for me,

120
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,440
at the beginning I only liked fruity wines.

121
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,640
And then I like wine with strong body.

122
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,679
And then you introduce me to the world of natural wines.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
At the beginning I feel like, oh, how weird, right?

124
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,320
But then I feel like, okay, this is what the wine

125
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,519
naturally becomes and I learn to appreciate those flavors.

126
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,960
So the taste varies by individual,

127
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,960
but I feel like it's also being able to be educated.

128
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,239
The exposure over time is how we learn.

129
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:27,679
Imagine a baby who's never seen certain colors before,

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
It sees orange for the first time and it makes a big impression.

131
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:10,619
A lot of people when it comes to wine only know like blue, red, and yellow.

132
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,820
Those are the only colors they know.

133
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,500
And that's like maybe they only know Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and Chardonnay.

134
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,339
And my perspective is I have all the colors of the rainbow and all the variations of the

135
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,699
colors and all the different textures and everything.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,759
So that's just because of exposure for maybe 10 years trying 20,000 different wines a year

137
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:14,460
and building up this sort of taste memory.

138
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,559
And for those who aren't able to taste that many wines, I would still encourage them to

139
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,679
find some favorites and always try new things too.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
That is a very important dimension.

141
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,440
I always want to try new wines.

142
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,800
But if I try, for example, a thousand bottles of Yellowtail, I won't be able to tell very

143
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
much.

144
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Right.

145
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,280
Then, like, there must be some, a lot of bottles.

146
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,920
Like we know each wine is unique and has its own, like, flavor.

147
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
But there must be some better wines and worse wines, right?

148
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, without question.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
And how do you tell?

150
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,719
How do you decide this bottle tastes good and that bottle doesn't taste good?

151
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:16,719
I don't think it requires a lot of heavy cognition to decide if something tastes good or not.

152
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,579
It's kind of an instant thing.

153
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:24,379
It's kind of like when you taste something that reminds me of your childhood, that feeling

154
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,339
of nostalgia is instant.

155
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,839
It doesn't require you to think about it.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
So the thing about our taste is that our preferences evolve over time.

157
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,359
So the wines that I may have enjoyed five years ago, I probably still like, but maybe

158
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,679
the wines that I first enjoyed ten years ago, I kind of graduate through to different styles

159
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,000
and I'm in the mood for different things.

160
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Same thing with music.

161
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,160
I find myself listening to some genres for like three months straight and then I'll switch

162
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,859
and go to something else.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
So I think our tastes do evolve and change over time.

164
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:11,199
But yeah, as far as like what's good, there's trends, there's things that are popular to

165
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,660
the general public.

166
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,600
But if we think about what's good, you think about with foods, most people start with things

167
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,480
that are sweet.

168
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,960
Most children hate, yeah, sweet things.

169
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,420
Most children hate bitter and sour.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,759
So usually the first wines that most people start with are soft, sweet wines.

171
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:15,080
And then as time goes on, we can develop an appreciation for sour and bitter and grow

172
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,079
to understand, you know, let's say Italian wines can be very bitter or, you know, certain

173
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,640
white wines can be quite sour.

174
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,719
And they can be displeasing at first if you're not used to it, but then you grow to like

175
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,719
it.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
bitter melon as a vegetable.

177
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm not used to bitter melon yet,

178
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but some people are used to it and love it.

179
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Even tea, or

180
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
beer, at the beginning all you taste

181
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is bitterness, but over time you can

182
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
tell this is oolong, this is

183
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
red tea, and over time

184
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you can tell this is good quality oolong.

185
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I like this kind of

186
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you don't taste the bitterness anymore,

187
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you just taste the quality or

188
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the goodness.

189
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I do

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I do find whenever you brought wine, I end up drinking the wine very happily.

191
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The taste can vary, but the feeling after drinking it is just, you know, I feel wholesome or whatever.

192
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It just feels good.

193
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But versus some commercial, even sometimes those wines can be very expensive, and I don't feel good after drinking those.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Like not body feeling, like it's not headache or anything, but just you don't feel satisfied, I guess.

195
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I think it can be compared with foods to things that are mass market processed foods versus home cooked ingredients.

196
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And a lot of the great wines that I enjoy are not made in large quantities.

197
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They're made on the scale of, let's say, 5,000 to 50,000 bottles per year by the winery.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Many commercial wines that are found in the grocery store

199
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,879
would be made in the hundreds of thousands

200
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,439
to millions of bottles per year.

201
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:13,320
So when getting to that more, it's more family farms,

202
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,320
family wineries, they are making wine that isn't,

203
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,920
doesn't have to be consistent across a million bottles.

204
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,679
It only has to be consistent across, let's say 10,000.

205
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,719
And when that scale is smaller,

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
the quality is just going to be higher.

207
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,799
Yeah.

208
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:07,960
Speaking of quality, we can go to the second factor, price.

209
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,800
Right.

210
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,400
What's the average or median?

211
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,559
What's the median price of a selection?

212
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,440
You know, so speaking in US dollars, I would say $50.

213
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,480
Retail for a bottle would be the median.

214
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,239
I do have many selections that are in the 20s,

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
and then I have some that are in the thousands as well.

216
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,080
But I am thinking of most days,

217
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
if I wanna drink a wine that has a lot of energy

218
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,199
and personality, I'm probably gonna reach

219
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,279
for something that's 40 to $60.

220
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,120
And that's where I'm at right now.

221
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,120
I didn't start at that level

222
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,280
when I was first getting into wine.

223
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,160
I was in the 10, 15, $20 level,

224
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,440
and I think most people should stay there.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,639
and there's a lot of great wines,

226
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,559
let's say in the 20s to 30s,

227
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,720
that's where quality is...

228
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,560
Possible.

229
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,720
Takes a big jump.

230
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,679
It takes a, okay.

231
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,919
Then the quality from 30 to 50, it's a smaller jump.

232
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,559
And then the quality from 50 to 100,

233
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,399
it's really not much of a jump.

234
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,079
And above 100, quality, it really does taper off.

235
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:29,079
So I think if people can get to like a $30 bottle,

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
That's where you can get amazing wine from anywhere in the world.

237
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,200
And these wines that end up being super expensive are...

238
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,679
they're priced like that because of

239
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,320
rarity and market demand, but it's not because of quality necessarily.

240
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,039
Shit. Because when I drink wine from China,

241
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,280
it's very difficult to get a good bottle

242
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,320
with 30 US dollars. Like usually you have to go to

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
like $1800-$200. Yeah, I think the economics of taxes and getting the wine there, market

244
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,440
to mine, yeah, it's, we probably have an advantage in the States and in Europe it's even cheaper.

245
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,199
Especially right now, right? Yeah. You're going down to half price. So let's take Burgundy

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,519
for example, I could get a really great Burgundy wine, let's say Louis Jadot Merceau here in

247
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,560
the United States for retail $75.

248
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,800
In China it's probably double or triple and in Europe it might be half.

249
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:28,440
So you know, part of it's shipping, part of it is tax and then availability, demand.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
So it's so interesting that the same bottle of wine can cost so many different prices

251
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
around the world.

252
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Yeah, okay.

253
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,500
But I guess in order to get good quality, good value wine, just check out your website.

254
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Yeah.

255
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,539
You should be anywhere in the United States, right?

256
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,260
Anywhere in the United States and then sometimes I can do international too.

257
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,260
Nice.

258
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,379
I should bring a case back home.

259
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,379
You should.

260
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,379
If I can.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
if I can. I don't think, yeah, the logistic is just not a memory.

262
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,320
That's a bit complicated.

263
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:13,519
Yeah. Okay, so your style is the representative of kind of a world history of wine.

264
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,640
Sure.

265
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,239
Yeah. And taste, quality.

266
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,800
The oldest bottle, the oldest bottle I have right now is from 1875.

267
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,280
1875, wow.

268
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,679
Yeah, that's a Madeira wine from Portugal.

269
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,280
Still Madeira wine.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
Oh yeah, and it should still be delicious.

271
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,759
And then the youngest wine would be 2021.

272
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,599
So, you know, a long history there,

273
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,519
almost 150 years of history.

274
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,120
So, that's pretty cool, huh?

275
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,320
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,559
Definitely worth checking out your wine list.

277
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,199
Sure.

278
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,679
Is it updated for all those?

279
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,280
Yeah, I try to update it every week.

280
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,719
And that's a whole task to itself.

281
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,920
But you enjoy doing so.

282
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,679
I enjoy it.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
It's sort of my, yeah, it's hard to say like my life's work,

284
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,560
but it's something that I've become good at

285
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,400
and keeps me energized, keeps my creativity going.

286
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,640
Nice.

287
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,559
Okay, let's go to the second phase of my questions.

288
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,120
You have been doing your own business,

289
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,199
unlike a lot of your colleagues,

290
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,640
and you deal with customers firsthand,

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
you deal with shipping, you deal with import first hand.

292
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,679
What do you feel like is lacking

293
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,400
or what do you want to fulfill?

294
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,679
Like where do you want to create value in this industry?

295
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,960
Other than what you have been doing right now.

296
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,519
Yeah, I mean, I think there are all these

297
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,219
different relationships that you've described.

298
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,800
I have my client relationships,

299
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,519
the different suppliers that I work with,

300
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,280
the wineries themselves, and then kind of the broader

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
audience of people who've never even bought wine from me,

302
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,160
but watch the posts and have followed my journey.

303
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,919
So I think one vision I'd like to do into the future

304
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,919
is to somehow tie that together and offer more resources,

305
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,559
maybe on video or audio,

306
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,000
just how I can share what it is that I do

307
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,559
and share my passion.

308
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,899
I'm a bit self-conscious

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,839
and it's not always easy for me to want to put out an idea

310
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,000
for fear of the natural criticism that might happen.

311
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Yeah, and there is always criticism.

312
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,880
Even if 100 people likes you,

313
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,760
and it takes one criticism to destroy our mood

314
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,280
and destroy our motivation.

315
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,739
And we have that negative bias where if we have 99 likes

316
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,239
and one thumbs down, the thumbs down,

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It stands out and it's what I might remember all day long.

318
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,400
So I think it's important.

319
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,960
I think any creator has to deal with that.

320
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,560
But when I'm here in the cellar by myself,

321
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,359
there's no one criticizing.

322
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,300
It's just me and my work and my headphones in

323
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,500
and all the bottles, my little friends here.

324
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,640
So I guess content is education

325
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,280
and just introducing people to like other

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Nice things behind. Yeah, I mean I think it'd be interesting to talk about the wines of course.

327
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,199
I'd also like to talk about how I do my work.

328
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,400
How, like educate on how I developed my inventory system.

329
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:21,100
Or how I do the shipping. How to wrap a bottle and send it to Singapore and have it show up in one piece.

330
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,800
How to negotiate doing the sales part. So all these behind the scenes things that I've just had to learn on my own.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
There was no one that really taught me in a package deal.

332
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,400
So that could be something that would be unique.

333
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Because there's plenty of people out there who say,

334
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,699
oh, this is what Pinot Noir is, or this is what Chardonnay is,

335
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,000
and how they taste.

336
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,300
But there's not too many that tie it all together with a business mindset.

337
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,199
I see. Maybe you can franchise a business someday.

338
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,000
Who knows? Yeah.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
But I mean, I follow a lot of content creators

340
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,080
and really enjoy whatever they have to say.

341
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,839
And I don't always watch all their videos

342
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,500
and some I like better than others,

343
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,679
but I do think that creators can add a lot of value

344
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,000
and just expand ideas.

345
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,839
One of the channels on YouTube that I started watching

346
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,160
was called Wristwatch Revival.

347
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,199
And it's this guy who takes apart

348
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,160
antique mechanical wristwatches, cleans them,

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
puts them back together, makes sure they're running.

350
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,200
And I'm not gonna become a watchmaker,

351
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,160
but I really like the process.

352
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,599
And I think there's a lot of people

353
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,060
who aren't even into wine,

354
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,640
who would enjoy the process of what I do.

355
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,480
Nice.

356
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,120
Maybe I can just lend you my camera

357
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,559
and we can film all day.

358
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,640
But editing videos,

359
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,719
if you enjoy editing videos, then that would be great.

360
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,519
Right, that's a lot of work.

361
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,000
It's not too much, but still it takes,

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Like you are already very busy, so.

363
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,839
Yeah, well.

364
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,800
But yeah, like if someone is interested in watching

365
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,640
or creating this kind of content,

366
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,240
maybe we can reach out to you.

367
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,559
Yeah, it'd be fun to partner with someone

368
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,600
who wants to do the production side.

369
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,039
And I could be the talking head.

370
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,920
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,679
And they can just hide and delete

372
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,440
all the negative comments for you.

373
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,280
That's right.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I don't have to see him.

375
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Well, it's like Johnny Depp.

376
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,320
I saw a quote that he said that he makes his movies,

377
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,960
but he never watches his own movies.

378
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,439
So I'd be interested to like talk and make the content,

379
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,440
but then not even watch it.

380
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,199
In terms of the industry, so this is,

381
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,039
you started this and you feel like

382
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,019
if you just tell people the process

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,319
or tell people, show people what to do,

384
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,380
it would be useful at least to you three years ago.

385
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,599
It would be, and maybe I'm giving away secrets and IP,

386
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,000
but you know what, who cares?

387
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,440
If you can encourage more people to be in this business,

388
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,179
I think it's a good thing.

389
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,019
Yeah.

390
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,079
Even if you create more competitors still.

391
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,719
I feel like the demand is much higher than Phoenix.

392
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,719
You know, let's say the knowledge and tools that I have,

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
it's like I have a really good hammer

394
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,080
and I might wanna keep this hammer to myself

395
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,599
because I'm able to build really well with it.

396
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,519
Well, just release the hammer

397
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,000
and ultimately whoever works the hardest

398
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,779
is going to build the best house.

399
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,480
So it's not just having the tools,

400
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,480
it's showing up every day and doing it rain or shine.

401
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,699
So I think that's the separator.

402
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,039
So just put the knowledge out there

403
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,879
and those who are willing to work,

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,559
they'll make use of it and I'm not worried about losing something by sharing.

405
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,560
Sure.

406
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
Yeah.

407
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
Okay.

408
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
Yeah.

409
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,560
That's one thing.

410
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,679
And about the industry, anything else?

411
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:21,199
You feel like there is an unsatisfied demand for wine consumers that you really want to

412
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,199
...

413
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,199
There are.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

415
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,759
Think there are millions of people who are

416
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,039
interested in eager and getting into wines and

417
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,359
I think there are enough wines that

418
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,359
Everyone can have but what?

419
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,719
sometimes happens is as soon as someone gets in a wine they want to get the rare collectible wines and

420
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:25,440
I think a lot of people a lot of the clients that I've seen

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,799
seen come and go are just interested in like,

422
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,799
oh, I have this one last bottle of something

423
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,839
and they want that trophy.

424
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,119
And then they move on to the next merchant

425
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,839
who has the next trophy.

426
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,440
So I think I would like to encourage

427
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,079
not just chasing the trophy wines,

428
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,120
but getting into, you know,

429
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,219
wine regardless of its sort of mystique.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
So that's like the ultra collectors who are into that.

431
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,059
And then there's people who have never tasted wine at all.

432
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,179
And there's a big chasm in between.

433
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,279
The big chasm in between.

434
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,599
I also feel this because before I met you,

435
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,000
I think she is the one who introduced me

436
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,600
to the world of like final quality,

437
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,679
but not so expensive wines.

438
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,539
And you are the one who really, you know,

439
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,640
showed me a lot and helped me do all the collections

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and had me really enjoy nice wines for a couple years.

441
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,480
But without knowing you,

442
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,720
I feel like I would be stuck in the place of, you know,

443
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,480
drinking Whole Foods or Trader Joe's or Costco wine

444
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,120
and never being able to be exposed

445
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,480
to the good things out there.

446
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,280
I know, and it's tricky because

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I ultimately don't know how to scale my business to the same reach of someone like a Whole Foods or a Costco.

448
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They have all the logistics in place and good quality wines for the masses.

449
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But I'm kind of a one-stop shop in terms of the products I can offer, but I think the knowledge I can offer could scale.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,960
But I think that if someone has the knowledge of 20 classic wines, that could be empowering.

451
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,679
It's just like with someone who is interested in cocktails.

452
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,960
If someone knows 20 classic cocktail recipes, they know cocktails.

453
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,199
So I think it'd be interesting, I'm just sort of riffing on this idea, of maybe come up

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
with a list of what are the 20 most important wine styles in the world that

455
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,679
someone could learn about and maybe list 10 options of each style. So it would be

456
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:18,239
maybe 200 different bottles. But yeah, what are the 20

457
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,539
wines that define the wine world right now and that's attainable for someone to

458
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,839
learn? Yeah, there was one cocktail book I really enjoyed. You know the book, but

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
I forgot the name. It's a square book with a lot of pictures.

460
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,400
Okay.

461
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,200
And they start with the six basic styles.

462
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,199
Right. Maybe it's liquid intelligence. Is that it?

463
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,199
No.

464
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,199
Okay.

465
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a different... I'll find it and I'll put it on the screen.

466
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah.

467
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,600
But it's six basic styles and all the derivations based on those six basic styles.

468
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Totally.

469
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
Yeah.

470
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,000
So, you know, in the wine world, Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, that would be on the list.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
For sure.

472
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,160
Napa Valley Charbonneau would not be on that list.

473
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,519
It's too niche.

474
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,560
So focus on the classics and explain why they're classics.

475
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:22,079
And then every other type of wine that's out there is sort of an easy reference point from

476
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,079
that basis.

477
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:29,960
Yeah, I feel like once you introduce the classics, then you can connect the dots, find linkages.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Yes.

479
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yeah, right.

480
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The history of Kubernetes and VL.

481
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Right.

482
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,759
And, you know, how it compares to different Kubernetes and VL.

483
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,839
And then the knowledge expands and you have a whole world to explore for yourself.

484
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,439
It's super interesting idea.

485
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:14,439
Okay.

486
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,439
Nice.

487
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,440
Nice.

488
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
All right.

489
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Anything else?

490
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,559
That's all I got for now.

491
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,559
Okay.

492
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:22,559
Short and sweet.

493
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,559
Okay.

494
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,559
Thank you, Nick.

495
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,559
Thank you.

496
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,879
Congratulations on the business growing year by year.

497
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,879
Well, thank you for your support.

498
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,879
Yeah.

499
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,879
Appreciate it, Wai-Z.

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Bye.

501
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
Bye-bye.
